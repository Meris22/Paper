## Datasets

The repository contains the following three files:

* `goldEN.json`: The annotated dataset for English news articles.
* `goldDE.json`: The annotated dataset for German news articles.

## Data Structure

Each JSON file contains an array of objects. Each primary object has the following structure:

* `original_text`: A string containing the full text of the source news article.
* `extracted`: An array of objects, where each object represents a single extracted future statement with the fields described below.

### Fields of an Extracted Statement

Each JSON object represents a single extracted future statement and contains the following fields:

| Field                          | Description |
| **Event Variable**             | The specific entity or variable the prediction is about. |
