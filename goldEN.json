The force would \"disarm renegade troops and police rebelling against the state\" and \"...Australia and New Zealand will come soon\" Mr Horta said to reporters.\n\nThe first troops from Australia's 1300 strong commitment to East Timor, which also includes three ships, helicopters and armoured personnel carriers, will likely arrive in East Timor by this afternoon, having been on standby in recent weeks in preparation for such a possibility. Two of the Royal Australian Navy's amphibious landing ships, HMAS Kanimbla and Manoora, are currently heading north to East Timor with troops on board, and the rest of Australia's 1300 strong task force would likely arrive in the next 48 hours. Approximately 120 Portuguese military police and 60 police and troops from New Zealand would join them. Australia may also send troops from 4 RAR (Commandos) and SASR from Holsworthy, NSW and Perth respectively.\n\nThe uprising in East Timor has resulted from the firing of nearly 600 East Timorese soldiers who went on strike, alleging ethnic discrimination and poor pay and conditions. They are led by the highest ranking officer in the renegade force, Australian-trained Major Alfredo Reinado, who East Timorese President Xanana Gusmao has vowed to hunt down, and who will undoubtedly be an important target for the Australian task force entering an ill-defined Area of Operations (AO) where East Timorese government forces have been battling the renegade troops and police.\n\nForeign minister Ramos-Horta told the ABC that he hoped foreign forces would not have to engage the renegade East Timorese troops but would have \"an immediate calming effect throughout the country\" and \"encourage political dialogue.\"",

    "original_text": "Volunteers and interested people could visit the Belgian Indymedia headquarters in Brussels on Sunday during their second open door day. Around 50 people came to hear about the organisation's evolution during 2007 and what's coming up for 2008. A book about citizen journalism, with contributions from both mainstream journalists and several alternative media experts, was also presented. And the Indymedians mingled, with loungy Creative Commons music in the background.\n\nIndymedia.be was founded in 2000, only a few months after Indymedia's inception at the alter-globalist protests at the World Trade Organisation's summit in Seattle. This made them the first Indymedia on the European mainland. The Independent Media Centers trademark is politically left, social reporting. The initial growth was slow, but during 2007, the organisation grew to around 110 regular contributors, with the first steps towards regional groups in Brussels and Antwerp. The public today could also visit the brand new media centre with new equipment. And although readership has increased exponentially to around 7000 visitors per day (and with it, server costs), finances have not, leading to a fund raising campaign.\n\nSeveral projects during 2007 aimed to increase the quality of the articles; research projects such as those on the Belgian elections and formation crisis centred on social issues, where the mainstream media itself recognised that the political debate was often monotonous and lacking content.\n\nNevertheless, bringing analysis and background will continue a challenge during 2008. During the photographer's workshop, the possibilities for photo documentary and photo-based interviews vs. simple photo reporting were illustrated as an alternative to bringing \"just a bunch of pictures from another street protest.\"\n\nAs a central player in the field of alternative media in Belgium, Indymedia also wants to stir the debate about participatory journalism. This has led to their first 'media reader' about the topic, and the creators hope more versions will follow.\n\nThe author of the book's introduction, Nico Carpentier, gave a lecture on participatory journalism and the challenges facing organisations like Indymedia. Carpentier is a researcher who teaches media studies at the Free University of Brussels, and has co-authored the book Understanding Alternative Media (Open University Press, 2007).\n\nCarpentier started his talk by putting citizen journalism in its web 2.0 context to explain some common critiques. He referred to the central position of the individual, who can use blogs to disseminate any personal thought, as 'net narcissism'. Symptomatic of this trend is the shift from the classic media 'organisation' to 'communities' of citizen journalists, noted Carpentier.\n\nHe also warned against a reductionist view of 'participation', and used YouTube to illustrate the lack of influence, shared ownership and responsibility contributors have in the dominant model of so-called participation -instead of creating media together, participation becomes 'posting something'.\n\nHe systematically used the term participatory journalism, because he feels the term citizen journalism is loaded with the problematic image of the amateur journalist, and the idea that 'Every Citizen is a Reporter'. Journalist Walter Zinzen argues fiercly in Indymedia's new book against would-be journalists who lack the skills that take traditional journalists years of training and experience.\n\nCarpentier elaborated on the pitfalls for participatory journalism initiatives. Such as the balance between participation and efficacy; or how the horizontal structure tends to slow down journalistic 'communities', and more so the larger they get. There is also the general lack of interest in a two-way communication system about the news, in a world where media products are consumer goods. And of course, continuous financial and organisational problems. Carpentier explained how working in the alternative media is rarely a life-threatening hobby in the Western world, but that a lack of government support is still a logical consequence of being a forum for criticism. Some alternative media manage to find alternative funding, while others have to adapt to meet government targets or are taken over by corporations.\n\nCarpentier concluded his lecture calling for more a network of alternative media which could foster collaboration with the mainstream media, based on mutual respect.",

The rig had caught fire after an explosion of unknown origin occurred two days ago. 115 of the 126 workers on board the time of the explosion have been rescued after evacuating in lifeboats, either by the Coast Guard or from other ships in the area.\n\nThe remaining eleven have not been located, although Coast Guard officials have expressed optimism that they are still alive.\n\nThe environmental impacts of the explosion and subsequent sinking of the rig are unclear. While up to 13,000 gallons of crude oil per hour has been released from the rig, until now, the effects have been considered minimal, as it had been burned off in the fire. That does have the potential to change, though, according to David Rainey, vice president of the lessor of the rig, BP. The rig, built in 2001 by Hyundai Heavy Industries was owned and operated by Transocean.\n\nThe rig was located roughly 50 miles southeast of the coast of Louisiana, and was under lease to BP since 2007. It was completing the construction of a new oil well, and was constructing a layer of cement in the well to reinforce it. This is considered dangerous, as it has the potential to produce an uncontrolled release of case, called a blowout. While the cause of the explosion has yet to be determined, a blowout is considered a possibility.\n\nOne survivor of the explosion, who declined to give his name, told the The New York Times that he was lying in bed when the explosion happened. \"It caught me by surprise. I’ve been in offshore 25 years, and I’ve never seen anything like that,\" he recalled.\n\nStanley Murray, the father of another survivor named Chad, an electrician, said: \"My son had just walked off the drill floor.\" However, Murray said that a neighbor did not make it in time, adding that his son told him that the missing eleven workers could not have made it out alive. \"The eleven that’s sic missing, they won’t find them,\" Murray said.",

Under the terms of an agreement signed last year, Nigeria will pay $12.4 billion in exchange for a\ndebt cancellation of an estimated $18 billion, representing about 60% of the $30 billion Nigeria owed the Paris Club creditors. The agreement is the biggest debt relief deal for an African nation.\n\nNigeria, Africa's largest producer of oil, has used \"windfall\" earnings from the prevailing high oil prices in making these payments.\n\nThe Paris Club agreement was negotiated in October 2005, with the Nigerian delegation headed by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the minister of finance. The deal is part of the free-market reforms pursued by President Obasanjo.\n\nThe announcement comes in the wake of the endorsement of the reform programme by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which marks the last step for the debt relief deal to be completed. Nigeria is the first country to qualify for the IMF's Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which provides assessment and endorsement of a country's economic policy by the IMF, for those countries that do not require fund assistance.\n\nSpeaking before the commencement of the Federal Executive Council meeting at the Council Chambers, State House, President Obasanjo said, \"By Friday, April 21, we would have cleared ourselves of all debts owed to Paris Club.\" He also added, \"Considering the outstanding debts to the London Club and those owed internally, we are not out of the woods yet.\"\n\n2006-04-23",

Fear of pollution increased after the ship was further damaged during storms last Thursday. MSC Napoli was beached by Devon coastguards after it suffered heavy structual damage in the gale force storms of Thursday, 18 January 2007, that wreaked havoc across Northern Europe. The ship, which contains 160 containers of hazardous chemical substances, is listing at 35 degrees.\n\nThe entire 26-man crew was rescued by navy helicopters Thursday after severe gales. Cracks were found on both sides of the ship, but the current oil leak was not expected.\n\nAround 2,400 containers were carried by the 62,000 tonne ship, some of which contain potentially dangerous hazardous chemicals.\n\nThe Coastguards have reported that up to 200 of the containers carrying materials such as perfume and battery acid are loose from the ship and they are looking for missing containers. South African stainless steel producer Columbus Stainless confirmed on Friday that there was at least 1,000 tonnes of nickel on board MSC Napoli.\n\nA hole in the ship flooded the engine room and there’s now fears that the ship will break up. Saturday MSC Napoli was towed to Portland when a ”structural failure” forced the salvage team to beach it. As the storms have continued MSC Napoli has been further damaged.\n\nThe authorities have warned people about the pollution, which already has reached the beaches at Devon, but many want to see it on their own. Police have closed Branscombe Beach as more than 20 containers have broken up scattering their contents along the beach.\n\nSky News reported Sunday that the costs of the accident might be very high as thousands of pounds worth of BMW motorbikes, car parts, empty oak barrels and perfume might get lost in flooding containers.",

    "original_text": "Afghanistan\n__NOTOC__\nAfghan President Hamid Karzai agreed yesterday to a runoff vote with former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah on November 7, after much international pressure, following a report on voting irregularities. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said that the United Nations has requested that the Independent Election Commission (IEC) replace 200 of its officials in order to avoid a repeat incident. President Karzai said it was \"time to move forward to stability and national unity\".\n\nWestern leaders commended President Karzai for agreeing to the runoff. \"While this election could have remained unresolved, to the detriment of the country, President Karzai's constructive actions established an important precedent for Afghanistan's new democracy,' said United States President Barack Obama. \"The Afghan Constitution and laws are strengthened by his decision, which is in the best interests of the Afghan people.\"\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown also commended Mr Karzai's \"statesmanlike behaviour\", whilst the European Union Special Representative Ettore Sequi reserved his congratulations for the Afghan people.\n\nUS Senator John Kerry is reported to have played a key role. In an interview with The New York Times, he said he told the Afghan leader about his experiences during his 2004 presidential election loss to former US President George W. Bush, when there were questions about some ballots that helped decide the outcome.\n\nUN officials say investigators found that 200 of the 380 district election chiefs in August's presidential vote were linked to polling irregularities or fraud. European Union observers believe that up to one in four of the votes were in doubt, and officials from the UN-backed Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) discounted ballots from 210 polling stations.\n\nThe UN mission in Kabul says that the removal and replacement of the officials had already started before yesterday's announcement of the runoff vote. Secretary General Ban said the UN had learned \"quite a painful lesson\" from the fraud. \"We realised that it was quite difficult for a young democracy to stand on its own, even with strong international assistance, particularly by the UN,\" he said. \"We will also try to visit all the polling stations to make sure that no such fraud can happen,\" he added.\n\nGrant Kippen, head of the ECC, said he believed the IEC is ready. \"They've been planning for this for a number of months now,\" he said. \"My understanding is that they're prepared. They have ballots printed, they have them here in Kabul along with the indelible ink and the polling station kits. So now the effort begins to get those materials distributed to the provinces and ready for the November 7 vote.\"\n\nThere are nevertheless difficulties ahead in implementing the runoff vote. Afghanistan has many large, mountainous regions, and some areas will become inaccessible due to snowfall. There are also security risks where militant factions still operate.\n\nUS Defense Secretary Robert Gates welcomed the announcement of the runoff vote, but said Afghanistan's struggles with corruption are larger than one election. During a visit to Japan, he said that there is a \"need to be realistic\" that tackling issues of corruption and governance in Afghanistan are an ongoing \"evolutionary process.\"\n\n\"Clearly, having the run-off, getting it behind us and then moving forward is very important,\" he said. \"But I think we need to be realistic that the issues of corruption and governance that we are trying to work with the Afghan government on are not going to be solved simply by the outcome of the presidential election. This is going to be a work in progress, an evolutionary process, and we need to be realistic on that.\"",

On Monday a strong winter storm moved across Europe, covering parts of France and the United Kingdom with several inches of snow.\n\nThe storm ranged as far as Germany, Belgium, and parts of Northern Italy. It brought with it freezing, Arctic-like temperatures ranging from -5° Celsius (23° Fahrenheit) to -10°C (14°F) in the United Kingdom and France, down to -31°C (-24°F) in central Romania and what felt like -26°C (-15°F) in Germany. Forecasters predict that the freezing temperatures may be the start of a cold spell that could affect the entire continent throughout the month.\n\nMonday's heavy snowstorm forced Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport, slightly north of Paris, to cancel most of its flights. 1,658 passengers from Air France alone were stranded at the airport after their flights were grounded due to the heavy snow and icy conditions. The passengers from the 120 cancelled Air France flights spent the night in hotels near the airport which were accommodated for by the airline.\n\nAn official from Air France stated that the passengers \"will have available food and hot drinks\". Most flights were grounded until the next morning. Tuesday, an official from Roissy-Charles de Gaulle said, \"It did not snow last night. The runways are clear and have been de-iced. Traffic is returning to normal.\"\n\nThe frigid temperatures resulted in several school closings across France and the United Kingdom, with government forecasters from both countries predicting that the cold would stay for several days. Many schools in the United Kingdom were closed because of problems with their heating systems, while heating repair services in Britain received a record number of calls this week.\n\nIn Paris, accumulating snow and slippery ice resulted in French officials closing pedestrian access to the Eiffel Tower, one of the city's prime tourist locations.\n\n\"We can't put down salt because it's metallic, we can't use sand either because it risks getting into the elevator,\" stated a press official from the Eiffel Tower. The tower remained closed on Monday and re-opened on Tuesday.\n\nThe storm has caused the deaths of at least 13 people, whether directly or indirectly. Polish government officials have reported that 10 people have frozen to death following overnight temperatures of -25°C as recorded throughout the country. Police in Germany reported that a 77-year-old mentally-ill woman also froze to death after she was reported missing from a nursing home in Weimar. Romanian officials reported that frigid temperatures killed two people and sent several to the hospital. Temperatures there were reported as low as -31°C in some parts.",

    "original_text": "Speculation is mounting in Rome with Vatican observers suggesting that many factors will go into the decision of who will be John Paul II's successor.\n\nIt has long been considered extremely unlikely that the next pope will be an American. Cardinal Francis George of Chicago declared in 2003 that \"to some extent, even the appearance of being in some sense captured by, as we say now, the world's only superpower, would not be helpful to the mission of the church.\" Some say the choice of a French Pope would also be overly controversial.\n\nThe Polish-born Karol Wojtyla was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. Though in Catholic tradition, the pope bears the title of Primate of Italy and Archbishop of the Roman Province, or for short, \"Bishop of Rome,\" this does not necessarily mean that he must be Italian, or Roman, as was demonstrated with the election of John Paul. Nonetheless, the rise of a non-Italian pope in 1978 may be followed by a desire to reclaim the chair by Italians.\n\nItaly will be the country with the greatest representation on the conclave, with 20 eligible cardinals. The US trails far behind at 11, and behind them are Spain (6), France (5), and Brazil (4).\n\nEurope forms the largest bloc with 58 papal electors, while Latin America and Africa have 21 and 11 respectively.\n\nJohn Paul II was a relatively unknown archbishop at the time of his election, indicating that it is not impossible for church leaders not well known throughout the church across the world to be potential recipients of the office.\n\nMany analysts suggest the strong possibility that the cardinals will seek to avoid electing a young pope in the wake of John Paul's 27-year reign. Age has been a factor in the choice of pontiff during the church's history, and may surface again. The New York Times speculates that cardinals may choose a slightly older pope \"in order to avoid another long reign,\" like that of John Paul II. Two well-liked figures, Angelo Scola of Venice, 63, and Christoph Schönborn of Austria, 60, may well be too young to be chosen for the office. Moreover, some feel that an older pope may be selected specifically to serve as a \"transitional\" figure following the previous lengthy papacy.\n\nAmong the most prominent 'papabili,' or likely potentials for the papacy are:\n* Dionigi Tettamanzi of Milan, 70\n* Angelo Scola, patriarch of Venice, 63\n* Josef Ratzinger, prefect of the Curia, formerly of Munich, 77\n* José Maria Bergoglio, Jesuit archbishop of Buenos Aires, 68\n* Ivan Dias, Mumbai (Bombay), 68\n* Rodriguez Maradiaga, Tegucigalpa, Honduras, 62\n* Claudio Hummes, São Paulo, 70\n* Francis Arinze, Nigeria, 72\n\nOthers include Giovanni Battista Re, 71, president of the Vatican commission for Latin America, and Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels, 71.\n\nAnalysts suggest that among the important issues around which the election of the next pontiff will center are candidates' position on socialism and capitalism, other religions or ecumenism, abortion, homosexuality, clerical celibacy, as well as their degree of progressivism or conservatism and relations with the international community.",

I knew at the beginning of the match that I could not win it,” she said.\n\nHenin-Hardenne’s retirement gave Mauresmo her third victory by default in the tournament. She reached the fourth round after Dutch player Michaella Krajicek retired with heat exhaustion. In the semi-final, Mauresmo was again the beneficiary of a retirement when Belgian player Kim Clijsters retired with an ankle injury.\n\nUntil now, 26-year-old Mauresmo was the only former world no.1 to never have won a Grand Slam title. She said in a post-match interview that when she returns home to her base in Geneva, Switzerland, she will toast the win with a bottle of 1937 Château d'Yquem wine which she has been saving to celebrate her first grand slam title.\n\n“I bought a bottle about three or four years ago. Very good one. Very old one also. I keep it. I thought, \"You know, this one is going to be for my Grand Slam, my first Grand Slam title,\"\" she said.\n\nMauresmo’s win comes seven years after the then unseeded player reached the 1999 Australian Open final, the last time she has reached a Grand Slam final. She lost to Martina Hingis and was berated by the press and several players for her muscular build and for acknowledging her then partner, Sylvie Bourdon, believing if they were open about their relationship, people would be less inclined to gossip. At the time, Lindsay Davenport complained that playing Mauresmo was like playing against a male player. While Martina Hingis accused her of being “half a man.”\n\nHenin-Hardenne’s retirement is the first time a player has retired from a women’s Grand Slam final since Brazil’s Maria Bueno retired in 1966 during a final against Australia’s Margaret Smith Court.\n\nMauresmo is now ranked world no.2 and is the first Frenchwoman to win an Australian Open since Mary Pierce won in 1995. Mauresmo takes home the Australian Open trophy and prize money of $AU1,220,000, while Henin-Hardenne walked away with the runner-up prize money of $AU610,000.",

    "original_text": "UkraineBetween 143 and 152 people have now been hospitalized in the wake of Monday's train derailment near Lviv, Ukraine, and subsequent phosporous cloud. According to the Ukrainian Healthcare Ministry's spokesperson, Igor Gerych, 43 of the injured are children, 13 are firemen and three are medical personnel. None are considered to be in mortal danger, yet some cases remain at medium risk level.\n\nNearly 400 people are involved with the clean-up operations. Among them are military specialists for chemical warfare. The Ukrainian Army alert state was raised to “high readiness” state on Tuesday, when the scale of the accident became clear. 27 medical brigades, 13 consultants and seven specialists are inspecting the surrounding inhabited areas.\n\nTwo of the fifteen phosphor containers that were involved in the accident have been raised and put on new transports; nine of them need more work to treat leaking and damaged areas. All containers are to be transported to a more secure location by Saturday.\n\nThe situation on the ground appears to be confusing. Political TV channel, Kanal 5, reports that the village closest to the accident, Ozhidovo, is still requesting volunteers to send medicines and water, as they do not have any. Journalists of three TV channels (Inter, Novyj Kanal, ICTV) needed medical care themselves after being in the village.\n\nTV channel, UT-1 reports this evening that the Ukranian President, Viktor Yushchenko, has called an urgent meeting of the National Security Council.\n\nThe accident appears to be likely to become a topic of contention in the long-standing rivalry between the President and the Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych. Yesterday, the President publicly criticized the government’s work.\n\nPoliticization of the disaster is likely to be the main reason behind the extreme differences among the versions of the Ukrainian media. Some declared the accident “ended” a few hours after it occurred, while others are still making alarming reports.\n\nOn July 18, the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC) of the European Commission reportedly offered EU assistance to the Ukrainian government. The same sources say that Ukraine has not officially requested the help. Without a formal request, EU assistance cannot begin.\n\nOn the same date, NATO Spokesman in Brussels, Mr. James Appathurai, is reported by Podrobnosti to have declared that the Alliance is following the situation, and that NATO has not received any request for help from the Ukraine, either.",

    "original_text": "Brigadier General Thomas W. Hartmann, an officer in the United States Air Force Reserve, is the subject of two new investigations. Both center on whether Hartmann abused his power as the Legal Adviser to the Convening Authority in the Department of Defense Office of Military Commissions. He no longer holds this position.\n\nThe United States Air Force is conducting an ethics probe after a preliminary investigation concluded that there were sufficient grounds to move forward. The inquiry is investigating allegations that cases which were not ready for trial moved ahead because Hartmann bullied prosecutors and logistics officials.\n\nThe other investigation is being conducted by the United States Department of Defense which is looking into complaints by at least two military officials that Hartmann acted in an abusive and retaliatory manner towards them while they served at the Office of Military Commissions.\n\nThese probes will \"cast doubt on all of the decisions that have been taken under his tenure,\" predicted Hina Shamsi, who serves as official trial observer at Guantanamo for the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nHartmann was recalled to active duty in July 2007 and appointed the Legal Advisor to the civilian official — known as the Convening Authority — in charge of Office of Military Commissions. The position of Convening Authority has been filled by Susan J. Crawford since February 2007. Hartmann's active duty term was to be for a two year term.\n\nThe duties of the Legal Advisor to Convening Authority included providing general oversight of the Prosecution and Defense teams, and providing advice to the convening authority when appeals are made.\n\nWhen Hartmann was appointed the Chief Prosecutor, Colonel Morris Davis was on medical leave. Hartmann was dissatisfied with the process of the commissions. In the nine months since the passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 only three captives had been charged. Hartmann is reported to have intervened in the operation of the Prosecution, pressuring Prosecutors to initiate charges against the captives suspected of being the more senior members of al-Qaeda.\n\nWhen Davis returned from his medical leave, he and Hartmann clashed. Davis felt Hartmann had improperly over-stepped his assigned duties, usurping his own role.\n\nDavis reported that his approach had been to charge captives whose trials could be conducted without access to secret evidence, and without access to evidence coerced through the use of torture or questionable interrogation techniques.\n\nDo you believe Brigadier General Hartmann abused power?\nIn October 2007, Davis went public and suggested that both he and Hartmann resign from the Office of Military Commissions. A military inquiry at the time censured Davis, who did resign from the Office of Military Commissions, and has subsequently testified against Hartmann.\n\nThe Presiding Officers of three of the Military Commissions heard testimony from Hartmann and eventually barred him from participation in the cases before them, because they believed he had exercised \"illegal command influence\".\n\nStephen R. Henley — the Presiding Officer of Mohammed Jawad's commission, who barred Hartmann from further participation — wrote on August 14, 2008:\n:\n\nAfter Colonel Patrick Parrish barred Hartmann from participation in Omar Khadr's commission, Hartmann's subordinate was promoted to replace him. Hartmann was moved to a new position, where he served over the Prosecution. Pentagon officials described it as a lateral move. Air Force officials described it as a promotion.\n\nOn November 2, 2008 Carol Rosenberg, writing in the Miami Herald, reported that Hartmann had filed a request to retire from the Air Force on 17 February 2008. Hartmann's superior at the Pentagon, William J. Haynes, had announced his resignation in February.",

Chief of Police Meerut said that the police entrusted to enforce a drive against obscenity had clearly gone overboard.\n\nTwo policewomen have been suspended and an internal inquiry has been ordered. The two were named as Inspector Madhu Malati and sub-inspector Mamata Gautam who were most active in the physical assault carried out on the women.\n\nThe targets of the assault were not satisfied. One of the women, aged 25, was taking a walk in the park with her brother when Inspector Madhu Malati descended on her calling her a whore and beating her up. Priyanka was kicked in the chest and slapped numerous times on her face just like dozens of other women who, after being beaten up were dragged to vehicles waiting to take them to the police station where their parents were called. They were later released after warnings.\n\nStudents spilled onto the streets of Meerut shouting \"Down with Police Dictatorship\" and set fire to effigies of cops.\n\nAfter the public humilation of being beaten up, abused and dragged to the police station to make statements, several couples did not make their way back home and are still reported to be missing.\nOriginal\nMembers of Parliament said this was the sign of a sick mind. News reports have quoted the Meerut Police range DIG as admitting to extreme and excessive treament by the police in Operation Majnu carried out in the company gardens on Monday.\n\nOne angry student protester said that this is a sign of hypocrisy and that India cannot be the country with the second largest population in the world if people sitting together in this country is such a sin.",

    "original_text": "China passed a new law that codifies a legal basis for authorising the use of military force to stop Taiwan from formally declaring its independence from the mainland. The anti-succession law was passed by the National People's Congress on March 8 in Beijing.\n\nThe deputy chairman of the NPC told members gathered at the Great Hall of the People that, \"If possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" The broad language of the law does not specify any exact measures China might take, but its effect is to reinforce the mainland's long held position of a one-China principle.\n\nThe Mainland Affairs Council in Taipei described the law as \"malicious\" and \"crude\". Taiwan views the development as violating international norms for peacefully resolving disputes. \"This law exposes China's plot to impose armed force to swallow up Taiwan,\" read the council's written statement. \"In essence, it has handed its military a blank check to unleash force against Taiwan.\" A Taiwanese Defence Ministry spokesperson announced that military exercises will be held this summer to practice defending against an attack.\n\nThe White House had urged China to reconsider the law before it was passed. White House press secretary Scott McClellan said, \"We view it as unhelpful - something that runs counter to recent trends toward a warming in cross-strait relations. We oppose any attempts to determine the future of Taiwan by anything other than peaceful means.\"\n\nChina has always officially maintained that Taiwan, which split from the mainland in 1949, is a rogue territory which must eventually reunify with China. Just recently in a ‘four point guideline' set forth on March 5, 2005, Chinese President Hu Jintao said, \"On no account shall the 1.3 billion Chinese people allow anyone to undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will not have the slightest hesitation, falter or concession on the major principle issue of opposing secession. The 'Taiwan independence' secessionist forces must abandon their secessionist stand and stop all 'Taiwan independence' activities.\"\n\nChinese opposition to a plan by Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian for a referendum on a new constitution that may violate Jintao's ‘four-point guideline' is seen in part as prompting the new law.",

However, forecasters say there is little chance of Dean moving toward Louisiana. Instead, the storm is expected to threaten Mexico or Texas.\n\nA hurricane watch has been issued for Haiti from the Haiti/Dominican Republic border to Port-au-Prince. Jamaica has opened all shelters and Cuba has declared a \"state of alert\" in preparation for the storm.\n\nA tropical storm warning remains in effect for the U.S. and Spanish Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.\n\nAt 5 a.m. EDT, the center of Hurricane Dean was about 240 miles south-southwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and 660 miles east-southeast of Kingston, Jamaica, and was moving west at 14 mph.

While average life expectancy is 81.4 years, second only to Japan's 82.2, and rates of cancer, heart disease and stroke are dropping, incidence of obesity, alcohol-related diseases, and sexually transmitted infections are on the increase.\n\nThe AIHW report highlighted the increasing gap between Australia's Indigenous population and the rest of the nation. Australian Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have a life expectancy around 17 years lower than the general populace, and in at least four states 71% of Aboriginals who died were under 65-years old, compared with 21% for the rest of the population. Indigenous Australians are reported to have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, respiratory illness, teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. People living in rural and regional areas were also found to have lower life expectancies and higher illness rates than their suburban and metropolitan counterparts.\n\nWhile obesity is a growing concern in Australia, AIHW director Penny Allbon expressed skepticism over a recent report from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute that claimed that Australia had overtaken the United States as the \"fattest\" nation in the world, with \"over four million adult Australians ... currently obese\". Allben commented that the institute's sample from 100 locations across the country may not be representative of the whole population. \"At the moment the ABS Australian Bureau of Statistics is out there measuring height and weight in a population-based survey, so we don't know the results,\" Dr Allbon said. \"We were just a bit concerned that the statistics that came out about us being the fattest in the world is not based on a population survey.\" AIHW reported the number of Australians being obese as closer to 2.5 million, with 7.4 million being overweight.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2005, the number of general practitioners in Australia has dropped 9%, although in regional areas there has been an increase of 15%.\n\nBased on the report, the AIHW has recommended that Australians consider lifestyle change, such as healthier eating and more exercise, to alleviate the pressure on Australia's public health system. \"In rank order, the greatest improvements can be achieved through reductions in tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, high blood cholesterol and excessive alcohol consumption,\" according to Dr. Allbon.",

The statement said that if the bill's final version contained the anti-torture terms, then \"the president's senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.\"\n\nThe amendment, an addition to the $440 billion dollar military spending bill, proposed by senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, would establish the Army Field Manual as the uniform standard for the interrogation of Department of Defense detainees and secondly prohibit cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of persons detained by the U.S. government.\n\nThe legislation comes in the wake of the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal and allegations of Human Rights Watch, which, in a recent report, accused soldiers of the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division of \"systematically torturing Iraqi detainees\". The report was critizised by a Department of Defense spokesman as using \"distortions and errors in fact.\"\n\nThe amendment received 90 votes in support, and 9 votes against in the Senate. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell, as well as 28 other retired senior military officers, also endorsed it.\n\nGeneral Powell said in a letter to McCain: \"Our troops need to hear from the Congress, which has an obligation to speak to such matters. I also believe the world will note that America is making a clear statement with respect to the expected future behavior of our soldiers.\" Powell said the Senate action \"will help deal with the terrible public diplomacy crisis created by Abu Ghraib.\"\n\nMcCain, a one-time P.O.W. during his military service in the Vietnam War, said after the vote that the White House should not be working against him on this issue: \"We think it would be very helpful because it would send a message to the world that the United States of America does not engage in torture. We will not treat people inhumanely. We will adhere to treaties that we are signatories to, and the men and women who do the interrogating will have clear instructions as to how to conduct interrogations.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who later voted for the bill, and White House lobbyists led the unsuccessful opposition to the amendment and senator Ted Stevens had argued that the amendment would prevent \"our people from taking the leadership.

Indian patients are also younger, with a mean age of 57 years rather than 63–68 years.\n\nThree-quarters of Indian heart disease patients are from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The poorer patients receive medical attention late, for reasons including lack of awareness of the symptoms and poor access to ambulances.\n\nPoorer Indians are also less likely to receive treatments proven to save lives. The study indicates that higher death rates in poor patients are not because of differences in risk factors, but because of differences in treatment.\n\nAnd the actual number of deaths could be higher as many patients might have died before reaching the hospital, the researchers say.\n\n\"Prior to this study, we did not have data of similar nature and magnitude from a developing country,\" Denis Xavier, associate professor at St. John's National Academy, Bangalore, and lead author of the study, told SciDev.Net.\n\nEighty per cent of the 7.1 million deaths due to heart disease in 2001 took place in poor countries, and India is expected to account for 60 per cent of the heart disease burden by 2010.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2020, the number of men with heart disease in developing countries is expected to increase by 137 per cent, and women by 120 per cent, compared to 30–60 per cent in developed countries.\n\n\"India is a likely representative of other nations facing similar socioeconomic challenges,\" says Kim Eagle, cardiology professor at the University of Michigan Medical Center, United States, and author of an accompanying comment article about the research in The Lancet.\n\n\"The increasing obesity epidemic, high rate of smoking in certain populations, and variable availability of modern medications and treatments creates a situation where coronary prevention efforts are far from optimal,\" he told the Science and Development Network.\n\nEagle says India — and developing countries in general — could take cues from developed countries' successful strategies to reduce risk factors for heart disease, such as banning smoking from public places, increasing taxes on tobacco and promoting awareness of diet.",

    "original_text": "Philippines\nOn Thursday, the Armed Forces of the Philippines reported that three representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were abducted in Patikul, Sulu.\n\nArmy officers have identified the victims as Swiss Andreas Notter, age 38, Italian Eugenio Vagni, age 62, from Montevarchi and Filipino Mary Jean Lacaba, age 37, a Davao-based ICRC engineer.\n\nThe Philippine National Red Cross said Saturday that the three hostages were still alive. \"We have received reliable information that our abducted colleagues are alive,\" said Anna Nelson, a spokeswoman for the Manila ICRC office. The MILF also confirmed that the 3 hostages are still alive.\n\nMILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal on Saturday said it was coordinating in the rescue of the ICRC hostages. \"The latest information we received is that the kidnappers are transferring their captives by land and sea from one island to another,\" said Iqbal, adding its forces will cooperate in the hot-pursuit of the group of Albader Parad.\n\nThe three workers first made communication with the ICRC on Friday and said they were all unharmed. They were able to call and spoke with their superiors in Manila. \"We are, of course, relieved to have heard their voices and to know that they are alive,\" said Jean-Daniel Tauxe, head of the ICRC delegation in Manila. \"We are not in a position to comment further, since our main priority is ensuring that nothing jeopardizes their safety, but it goes without saying that their families, as well as their colleagues, are hoping for their safe and swift return,\" he added.\n\nTwo calls were made, one on Friday night and the other early Saturday morning, said ICRC spokesperson Anna Nelson and Senator Gordon. Rebel leader 'Parad is planning to demand 5 million dollars while Dr. Abu is reportedly planning a still unknown political demand' for the safe release of the ICRC team, Monsters and Critics said Sunday based on military reports.\n\nThe Department of National Defense on Friday has accused the terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group faction as responsible for the forcible abduction. The militants have fled with the ICRC victims to Talipao town, Defense Secretary Gilberto C. Teodoro, Jr. said.\n\nAccording to Chief Superintendent Bensali Jabarani, Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao police chief, there were reports of sightings of the captives late Friday in a wooded area of Indanan in the interior of Jolo. \"We got information from some residents fleeing the area,\" said Jabarani, adding a group of about 30 gunmen were guarding the three hostages. Of the three, the two foreign hostages were spotted by villagers in Maimbung, Sulu near Indanan late Friday.\n\nThe military authorities confirmed Sunday the abductors were under notorious rebel commander Albader Parad and Akmad Jumdail alias Dr. Abu Pula of the Islamist Abu Sayyaf group. Sulu police chief Senior Supt. Julasirim Kasim said Parad and another Abu Sayyaf leader, Sulaiman Patah both participated in the kidnapping and were part of the armed group that seized the ICRC representatives Thursday. Parad’s group was also blamed for the kidnapping last June of ABS-CBN news anchor Cecilia Victoria Oreña-Drilon and two other staff of the network.\n\nThe ICRC has temporarily stopped operations in southern Philippines because of the Patikul abduction. \"We are temporarily halting operations in the area so we can revisit and assess our security arrangements. Our main concern is the safety of our colleagues,\" said Roland Bigler, ICRC's spokesman in the Philippines.\n\nAccording to Sen. Richard Gordon, Philippine National Red Cross chairman, the ICRC workers from Italy, Switzerland and the Philippines were driving to Jolo Airport after visiting a provincial jail when at least eight motorcycle-riding armed men intercepted them. They were seized as they emerged from the Area Coordinating Center (ACC), where they interviewed officials of the Sulu Provincial Jail. Six young boys are among a dozen gunmen who kidnapped the workers, an ICRC staff member said Friday.\n\n\"I am appealing to the Abu Sayyaf to free those people, because they are neutral in any conflict,\" Mr Gordon said. \"Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention prohibits the abduction or kidnapping of persons taking no active part in hostilities, such as the ICRC which is an impartial humanitarian body that offers services to both parties in conflicts,\" Gordon explained.\n\nThe kidnappers, however, released Dr. Richie Sorilla, ICRC medical field officer; Ramon Catacutan, senior field officer; and Mohamad Shihata Jikiri, field officer. Their ICRC vehicle was later recovered in the village of Banganan, Patikul town by members of Task Force Comet, headed by Maj. Gen. Juancho Sabban. The kidnappers were on their way to Barangay Bud Pula in Patikul town, the military said.\n\nJolo Gov. Sakur Tan said the three workers arrived in Jolo on Wednesday for “humanitarian activities,” and to conduct a probe into the jailbreak wherein 12 local prisoners escaped and one was killed. \"They had been carrying out a water and sanitation project to improve the condition of detainees,\" ICRC spokesman Reynaldo Guioguio explained.\n\nPhilippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has directed the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Philippine National Police (PNP) to rescue the three victims and conduct an \"all-out pursuit\" of the militants. “The security forces, both AFP and PNP are in hot-pursuit operations to track down the criminal elements and ensure the safe return of the captives. The elite Task Force Comet under Maj. Gen. Juancho Sabban has been tasked to undertake appropriate action on the ground,” said Press Secretary Jesus Dureza. According to a U.S. military official, American soldiers were also providing noncombat \"assistance and advice\" to the elite Philippine military group on rescue operations.\n\nThe Philippine troops have fanned out on a southern island to search for the gunmen. They were scouring Friday the jungles of Indanan and Patikul jungles in Sulu. The military is also now looking for a former Sulu Provincial Jail warden, who may have involvement in the kidnapping and the recent jailbreak.\n\n\"We have established the identity of one of the kidnappers. He is Raden Abu, nephew of Parad, a dismissed guard of the Patikul jail. He was present, looking around when the kidnapping happened,\" said Lt. Gen. Nelson Allaga, Western MIndanao Command chief and Sulu police chief Senior Supt. Julasirim Kasim Friday.\n\nItalian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini has activated Thursday the Ministry's crisis unit and the Italian Embassy in the Philippines to monitor developments in the Sulu abduction of Italian citizen Eugenio Vagni. \"The Crisis Unit is already in contact with Mr Vagni's family and is following the situation in close coordination with the Embassy in Manila, the Philippine authorities and the Italian Red Cross,\" said the Ministry. The ICRC chapter in Geneva, Switzerland has also mobilized its “cellule de crise\" to follow up on the abduction incident, the Italian Embassy announced.\n\nThe Abu Sayyaf Group is one of several militant Islamist separatist groups based in and around the southern islands of Philippines, in Bangsamoro (Jolo, Basilan, and Mindanao) where for almost 30 years various Muslim groups have been engaged in an insurgency for a state, independent of the predominantly Catholic Philippines. The group, which emerged in the early 1990s, is notorious for its kidnappings. The Group's 340 members remain active in Sulu and Basilan provinces.\n\nMeanwhile, US Ambassador to the Republic of the Philippines Kristie Anne Kenney has on Thursday night condemned the kidnapping of the three ICRC representatives. \"I’m horrified. These are people who, throughout the country, do a wonderful work. And I think it’s appalling that they would be falling into any kind of harm’s way,\" she said.\n\nThe Philippine Council for Islam and Democracy (PCID) officer Amina Rasul on Friday also condemned the Sulu abduction. She called on the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), and civil society groups for assistance in the rescue of the victims. \"The full force of ARMM and the Sulu provincial government should be brought to bear on this problem of lawlessness,\" Rasul said. Human Rights chairperson Leila De Lima asked the militant group to release and permit the 3 workers to continue their humanitarian work in Sulu and Jolo island.",

They tried to break into the office and frightened staff.\n\nThe four were described as three women and one man wearing white painter suits and face masks. One was recording the event on video. A constituency assistant said they put posters on the outside of the building. They splattered the front of the building with paint.\n\nThe paint represented three official colours of the Olympic flag; yellow, red and green.\n\n\"I think the activists should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" said the premier. \"Frankly, this is about seeing their faces on television.\"\n\nAttorney General of British Columbia Wally Oppal spoke out against the group: \"It's disturbing when you have people like these, who are continually intimidating law-abiding citizens and I think the public is getting sick and tired of this group.\"\n\nThe group vandalised and broke into Campbell's office in Vancouver last May when they posed as a flower delivery service and quickly ransacked his office breaking windows and throwing pictures, office documents, and various other items. They also threw yellow paint and put posters on the Olympic Clock in downtown Vancouver last April.\n\nThey believe that poor citizens are losing their homes due to the money spent and developments near the city on preparation for the long-awaited 2010 Winter Olympics.\n\n\"Why we went to the premier's office was to protest the budget, the lack of any real money being spent on what poor people need, you know, housing, not hotels but real social housing,\" said David Cunningham, a spokesman for the group. The budget has \"billions of dollars compounded in surplus at the expense of poor people's lives,\" he told the CBC.\n\nCunningham said the group will not stop the \"criminal acts\" until the government's budget surplus is spent on social housing and on the citizen's.\n\n\"Just after 2 p.m. a group of people attended the premier's office … and threw paint on the exterior of the building,\" said Const. Jana McGuinness of the Vancouver Police Department. \"This is a criminal charge. This is mischief, so if charges are warranted we'll definitely be laying charges.\"\n\nNo arrests were made as the four managed to leave before police arrived.",

The accident occurred in Periyar National Park located in the city of Kerala. The bodies of a mother, her child and one other individual were among the latest victims pulled from the water.\n\nOn Wednesday, a boat carrying 75 people, mainly women and children, was returning from a fair that marked the end of the Durga Puja, an annual Hindu festival celebrating the worship of the Hindu goddess Durga. Fifteen people, including the boat driver and two staff members, were able to swim to safety after the boat capsized, but officials believe there are no other survivors. Reports say the person driving the boat turned sharply to one side before it capsized.\n\nWikinews obtained exclusive pictures of the boat before and after the accident. Images show the boat significantly leaning to one side shortly before the accident occurred. A later image shows the boat almost entirely submerged as rescue workers frantically work to rescue the trapped passengers.\n\nAccording to the Indian Express, the boat was being operated by workers who were not trained in rescue tactics had the boat been suddenly damaged. The paper also claims that of the two person crew, a driver and a lascar named Victor Samuel, neither were assigned direct control of the boat. The paper also says the boat was not licensed to operate in the area it was traveling. The paper cites a 1921 law, which says the driver must watch over the engine while another crew member, a 'srank', drives the vessel, but no one in that position was aboard the vessel when it capsized. Samuel said that he only obtained his lascar license one year ago, contradicting earlier reports that suggested he had more than 15 years of experience driving similar boats.\n\nOfficials are continuing to investigate the incident. So far, no criminal charges have been filed. The boat was made of mostly fiberglass, had two decks and was owned an operated by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, a government-owned company. According to reports, Samuel was only licensed to operate wooden boats and had no experience driving ones made of fiberglass. Samuel and the two staff members have been suspended pending the results of the investigation.",

By 11:00 p.m. the fire had spread over to the roof of the gate.

According to Business Desk of the Brunei Times, AusAID promised AU$3.2 million in funding, while GEF promised US$1 million. The country was the first in the Pacific to make a deal with the World Bank.\n\nThe funding was part of a US$530 million (NZ$635 million) package announced at yesterday's Pacific Energy Summit in Auckland involving New Zealand and the European Union, Australia, the Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the World Bank Group, and the United Arab Emirates. Also at the summit yesterday, New Zealand's Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully had announced a national commitment of USD$54,262,000 (AU$51,861,000 NZ$65 million, €42,178,000) to Pacific region energy solutions, of which US$8,348,000 (AU$8 million, NZ$10 million, €6,483,000) would be specifically earmarked for renewable energy and improved energy efficiency in the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu.\nitsdeadjim=1Kiribati is heavily dependent on diesel fuel for most of the energy available on the national power grid, which supplies power to half Kiribati's population of 110,000. In addition, a third of the country's population lacks access to electricity. Once installation of the solar panels is complete, they are estimated to reduce diesel consumption by 230,000 liters (60,760 gallons) a year and give access to the electricity to some parts of the population that currently have no electricity. The European Union already has committed €100 million to sustainable energy in the region, with €10 million of that coming as a result of an announcement made last week.\n\nIn a press release about the news, Kiribati President Anote Tong was quoted as saying, \"Kiribati faces big challenges it is remote, it is at risk from the effects of climate change, and it is vulnerable to economic shocks. ... Shifting Kiribati's focus to reliable solar energy will provide a more secure, more sustainable power source for the country's people.\" Radio New Zealand International quoted Tong as saying, \"It's the first time we are doing this. We're excited at the prospect of even substituting fossil fuel to a small extent at this stage. What the system being envisaged will only produce around 500 kilowatts, but this is the beginning of what I hope will be a pattern, the trend in the future.\"\n\nThe European Union's Fiji-based head of operations for the Pacific region, Renato Mele, supported alternative energy solutions like solar power for the region, but said that solar power had limitations because climate and environmental conditions sometimes meant batteries required to power the panels had a life of only 12 months, compared to other climates where batteries normally last five years. This created the potential to drive up standard operating costs. Mele has also noted these additional costs though are still lower than the cost of diesel power.\n\nOne News Pacific Correspondent Barbara Dreaver noted, \"Governments will be able to put the money they (currently) spend on diesel into things like education and health.\"",

The channel's remaining 8 million subscribers may not give it enough audience to ensure its survival, according to some experts.\n\nThe network received critical acclaim for a quirky lineup that includes the series, Brilliant But Cancelled, which took American broadcast networks, including parent NBC, to task for cancelling quality programs.\n\nTrio originally got its start in the 1980s as a Canadian cable channel owned by the CBC. Its original slate was described as \"a general entertainment channel that features the most successful contemporary dramas, documentaries and films from Canada, the UK and Australia. For the last six years, TRIO has been the largest exporter of Canadian TV programs to the US with over 3,000 hours of content,\" according to CBC press releases.\n\nThe channel's Canadian roots were cut in 2000 when media mogul Barry Diller snapped up Trio and sister channel News World International from the CBC and partner Power Corp. for $155 million in cash. Diller saw the channel as a cheap consolation prize after he was outbid by NBC for the Bravo cable network earlier that year. Within months, Diller rebranded Trio, dumped the Canadian dramas and geared it more toward edgier pop culture programming.\n\nOver the next couple of years, Trio changed hands twice. First to Vivendi Universal, then to NBC in a package deal that landed the American TV network a movie studio and the USA and SCI FI cable networks. Trio was seen as more of an afterthought at the time.\n\nIn a hint of what may be the fate of the channel, NBC Universal moved most of Trio's executive and programming staff over to Bravo, a now-sibling network, which is seen in 80 million U.S. homes. Some experts predict that Trio will eventually be folded with its more successful programming ported over to Bravo.\n\n\"Trio was a refreshing oasis on the dial, with a quirky pop-culture attitude that showed in its programming. Trio leaving is kind of like having a witty friend move out of town,\" Gael Fashingbauer Cooper, MSNBC television critic said in her weekly column. \"It'll be missed.\"\n\nNBC Universal has not commented publicly on the long-term future or specific plans for Trio channel besides to say it was committed to programming the network for current subscribers as the conglomerate re-evaluates its digital cable strategy.",

    "original_text": "Space\nThe Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has found evidence of hydrated silica or opal, a form of mineral, over large areas in the Martian surface, including in the large martian canyon called Valles Marineris. The discovery was made by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) instrument on the orbiter. The findings are published by Ralph Milliken of Jet Propulsion Laboratory and other scientists in the November issue of the journal Geology.\n\nOpaline minerals were first found recently on Mars by Spirit rover in the Gusev crater. The present find points to more widespread occurrence of the minerals in comparatively younger strata of Mars. The find indicates that liquid water might have been present on the surface of Mars for a longer time than previously thought. The previous view was that liquid water disappeared from the Martian surface three billion years ago. Now it is estimated that water could have been present as late as two billion years ago.\n\nThe presence of opal not only indicates water, but also that it was there long enough to alter some of the rocks. CRISM, which detected the mineral measures visible and infrared reflection spectra in 544 channels and has 20 times better resolution than previously deployed instruments.\n\n4=Dr Scott Murchie, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Maryland\n\nHydrated minerals such as opal that indicate presence of water is yet another evidence of presence of liquid water on Mars. Opal found on Earth's surface usually contain 3 &amp;ndash; 10% water, but can be as high as 20%. Other water-bearing minerals found earlier are phyllosilicates and hydrated sulfates. Presence of liquid water is also suggested by suspected water-sculpted land forms on Mars, such as gullies and river channels. Currently water is present only as ice at both polar caps of Mars.\n\nA number of outcrops of opaline minerals are found as thin layers over large distances, rimming the Valles Marineris canyon. It is expected that Martian explorations for past or present life will have to focus on similar younger terrains with hydrated minerals.\n\n\"This is an exciting discovery because it extends the time range for liquid water on Mars, and the places where it might have supported life,\" said Scott Murchie, from Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, one of the co-authors.",

But then organizers from a second union, the California Nurses Association, visited the hospitals to encourage the workers to vote not to join the S.E.I.U. These actions led to the service employees union on Tuesday asking to postpone the vote by workers at the nine hospitals, all which are a part of the Catholic Healthcare Partners system.\n\nAndy Stern, the service president is quoted as saying, \"nothing more than a flimsy cover for out-and-out union busting that we normally see from employers, not organizations that claim to care about workers.\"\n\nThe California Nurses Association, said it dispatched organizers to Ohio because in its view the unionization efforts were part of a \"sweetheart deal\".\n\nRose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the nurses association, condemned this agreement. She called it \"a rigged scam\" in which the service union would bargain without care if they won the vote.\n\n\"This was a top-down deal between an employer and a hand-picked union,\" Ms. DeMoro said. \"There was a gag order on everyone, and as a result this was a banana republic election.\"\n\n\"As for the future,\" DeMoro said, \"no election is planned.\" She said that delaying the election was \"a significant victory for employee rights.\"\n\nDave Regan, president of a service employees’ local representing 35,000 health care workers in Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky, called the nurses union’s conduct as, \"Their conduct is indistinguishable from that of the most vicious anti-union employers,\" Mr. Regan said. \"It violates every principle of unionism. Real people are worse off today as a result of their behavior.\"\n\nOrest Holubec, spokesman for Catholic Healthcare, said the system’s hospital in Lima had obtained a restraining order to bar the California nurses from entering restricted patient-care areas and aggressive leafletting outside hospitals. \"They were doing exactly the kind of things we were trying to avoid,\" Mr. Holubec said. \"They poisoned the well to the degree that we didn’t have the conditions that we tried to establish for a pressure-free environment.\"",

    "original_text": "Wikinews has learned that the internet group known only as \"Anonymous\" has hacked the website of the No Cussing Club (NCC), nocussing.com, for at least two days in a row. On day one, the group hacked into the website, replacing the content with links to images of alleged e-mail conversations. The e-mails appear to be from the founder's e-mail account, accusing organization members of forgery and using the site for their own personal financial gains. The website was also replaced with Anonymous's logo and a message. On January 22, they again attacked the website, by means of a Distributed Denial-of-service attack (DDoS), bringing it offline periodically throughout the day. Anonymous attacked the Scientology website in 2008 with a DDoS attack, taking it off-line for at least two days.\n\n\"It has come to our attention that the creators of the no cussing club, McKay and Brent Hatch have done so at great personal gain. Their material promotes the organization as the brainchild of their 14-year-old son, when actually the material is written by his parents, who also manage his profitable career while using his speaking events to plug their own material,\" said Anonymous on the hacked website. On Encyclopedia Dramatica, a satire Wiki, they claim further responsibility for the hack and exposition saying they managed to break into McKay and Brent Hatch's email accounts. \"the accounts got haxx0rd and via this astonishing development passwords were got and a certain website got its shit ruined.\"\n\nAccording to the NCC's website, it has 20,000 members worldwide, was founded in 2007 by McKay Hatch, a 14-year-old boy, and aims at discouraging swearing in public places such as schools. In 2008, McKay even succeeded in making cussing illegal in his hometown of South Pasadena, California and has appeared on various talk shows such as that of Doctor Phil. However, according to e-mails leaked to Wikinews, allegedly written by the boy's father Brent, a motivational speaker also owning Dawson Publishing, the parents are allegedly using the site and their son's material for their own personal financial gain. Anonymous also claims that the parents have forged some of their son's writings and claim it to be his.\n\nThe e-mails allege that Brent along with his publishing company, the name which \"nocussing.com\" is also registered under, were trying to set up assemblies in the No Cussing Club's name at schools across the United States for US$1,500.00 per show and would then pocket the money, doing the same for postcards they created for churches and schools.\n\n\"McKay spoke last night to a group of 40 people, and at the end of his presentation, there wasn't a dry eye in the crowd. I know this is going to work because the message is so important. Thanks for all you do and I hope we can work together for a long time, and of course make money in the process,\" said Brent in an alleged e-mail conversation on November 25, 2008. Earlier in August 2008, Brent spoke about hoping to reach a \"goal\" of \"2.5 million dollars\" by selling thousands of postcards to \"schools and churches\".\n\nOn January 19, 2009, ABC News.com reported that McKay claimed Anonymous was sending him and his family hate e-mail and death threats, nearly 50,000 per day, \"almost all of them filled with obscenities\" and spam. On the NCC's website, McKay calls himself the \"most cyberbullied kid on the planet\" because of Anonymous's attacks.\n\n\"A lot of people were saying I was taking away their freedom of speech,\" said McKay to ABC News on January 16. \"All I was trying to do was raise awareness.\" He says he formed the club because his schoolmates were sick of hearing people swear in public. Wikinews contacted the NCC to confirm or deny the reports, but would only say that \"the FBI is working on it the case\" including \"our attorney and we will press charges\" against those who are responsible for the crimes.\n\nAnonymous is known to prank and hack websites and e-mail accounts. In September 2008, the group hacked into BillOreilly.com, the official website of Fox News Channel commentator Bill O'Reilly, exposing personal information of the site's users in a document posted on the internet.\n\nThe NCC is located in South Pasadena. According to the California Penal Code §502 part C of the computer hacking laws, depending on the offense if caught, punishments could be a \"fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months, or two or three years, or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment\".\n\nOn October 20, 2008, Dmitriy Guzner, aged 18 from New Jersey, admitted to the charges related to carrying out the DDoS attack on Scientology's website. He was subsequently charged with computer hacking crimes and faces a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment.",

The email claimed that the members of the flotilla were \".. experienced boaters, licensed fishermen and hunters, people who have spent their entire adult life and teenage years on the waterways of Louisiana.\"\n\nThe email reports that a Dept. of Wildlife &amp; Fisheries (DWF) agent ordered them to turn around and go home.\n\n\"We then specifically asked the DWF agent that we (and other citizens in the flotilla) be allowed to go to the hospitals and help evacuate the sick and the doctors and nurses stranded there.

    "original_text": "ScientologyA United States federal court judge and Florida state court judge are enmeshed in a conflict against each other regarding a wrongful death lawsuit involving Scientology.\n\nA federal judge for the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Steven Douglas Merryday, ordered Pinellas County Senior Circuit Judge Robert E. Beach not to intervene regarding appearance of an attorney in a federal court case involving Scientology. Lawyer Kennan Dandar is representing the estate of Kyle Thomas Brennan in a wrongful death claim against the Scientology organization.\n\nThe suit asserts that members of the Scientology organization, including the father of Brennan, removed access to the deceased's anti-depression medication, and provided him with means to utilize a loaded gun. Brennan had been staying with his father for a week prior to his death. Police in Clearwater, Florida investigated the 2007 death of Brennan, and determined it was a suicide. Kyle Brennan was himself not a member of Scientology. The lawsuit, filed in 2009, was filed by Brennan's mother on behalf of her son's estate. Named as defendants in the lawsuit include the Scientology organization, its subdivision the Flag Service Organization, twin sister of Scientology leader David Miscavige &amp;ndash; Denise Gentile, and her husband Gerald Gentile.\n\nAttorney Dandar had previously represented the estate of Lisa McPherson in a separate civil wrongful death claim against the Scientology organization. After being under the care of members of the Scientology organization for 17 days, McPherson died in Clearwater in 1995. The wrongful death suit claimed that Scientology officials permitted McPherson to deteriorate to a dehydrated state, where her condition was such that she did not have the energy to fend off cockroaches from biting her skin.\n\nScientology management settled the McPherson wrongful death case in 2004; lawyers representing the organization stated the settlement included a confidential arrangement with Dandar to never again represent clients in lawsuits against Scientology entities. The settlement included an agreement that both sides would never speak again about the case; California lawyer Ford Greene commented, \"The church bought silence.\" The Scientology organization had also filed a countersuit against the estate of Lisa McPherson, and named Dandar a party to that lawsuit. The organization claimed Dandar had inappropriately tried to add the head of Scientology David Miscavige as a party to the wrongful death lawsuit.\n\n4=Kennan Dandar\nScientology legal representatives requested Judge Beach to see to it that Dandar abide by the secret settlement agreement, and Beach subsequently issued an order in June 2009 that Dandar be removed from the Brennan wrongful death case. Dandar faced sanctions from Judge Beach including suspension of Dandar's license to practice law, a US$130,000 judgement to be given to the Scientology organization, and a fine of $1,000 per day. Judge Beach ruled that all money from the sanctions imposed against Dandar &amp;ndash; were to go directly to the Scientology organization. The Tampa Tribune noted that Judge Breach made his ruling, \"in an inexplicably closed hearing from which Beach tossed a St. Petersburg Times reporter\".\n\nFaced with these possible sanctions, Dandar filed an \"involuntary\" motion to withdraw from the Brennan wrongful death case in federal court, but Judge Merryday denied this request. Dandar stated to The Tampa Tribune, \"I'm stuck in the middle of two courts.\"\n\nD. Wallace Pope, a lawyer for the Scientology organization, stated that he wished to show evidence regarding the settlement in the McPherson wrongful death case. However, Judge Merryday emphasized his main issue was determining whether or not Dandar was being penalized for obeying the federal court's order denying his request to be withdrawn from the Brennan wrongful death case. Judge Merryday stated he would prevent the Scientology organization along with Judge Beach from punishing Dandar for representing his client in US federal court. Merryday stated Beach had attempted to usurp control outside of his jurisdiction, thereby \"aggressively\" interferring with the US federal court process through imposing sanctions on Dandar.\n\nMerryday has served as a US federal judge based in Tampa, Florida since 1992. The St. Petersburg Times noted that Judge Merryday, \"has presided over some of the region's most noteworthy cases.\" Judge Merryday's court order creating an injunction against Beach was 29-pages long, and criticized the \"stunning severity\" of Beach's sanctions imposed on Dandar. Merryday explained that the federal court needed to \"act in defense of the (federal) court's jurisdiction\", due to Beach's actions. Referencing Judge Beach, Merryday wrote in his court order, \"A judge should not undertake, directly or indirectly, overtly or through a surrogate, to compel an act by another judge, especially in a different jurisdiction.\"\n\nJudge Merryday stated to Scientology lawyers, \"have forced my hand on this issue.\" Merryday stated to Scientology lawyer, Robert Potter, \"I don't like being put in this position. When people start to squeeze, other people can squeeze back.\" Potter asked him to seal the proceedings from public view, and Judge Merryday responded, \"I'm not going to be entering any seals unless I see a lawful reason, and I can't even see the beginning of a reason\". Merryday stated he would not allow his court to be influenced by \"some circuit judge somewhere who appears for all I can tell to have sealed something for some unknown reason\".\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the sanctions imposed on Dandar by Judge Beach?\nJudge Beach responded to Judge Merryday's injunction which \"permanently enjoined\" him from imposing sanctions on Dandar, by filing a motion on Thursday in federal court in Tampa. Beach asked Merryday to rescind his order so that he may recuse himself from acting as a judge on the Scientology case related to Dandar. Beach's motion argued that he was denied due process because he was not given notice by Merryday of the hearing which occurred before Merryday issued his ruling. In addition, Beach asserted Merryday did not have power to issue the ruling restricting him from sanctioning Dandar, because Beach was not a party to the Brennan wrongful death case, and Merryday lacked authority to restrict powers of a judge from outside his federal court jurisdiction. In response, Judge Merryday has scheduled a hearing for October 12 in federal court to hear state court judge Beach.\n\nMartin Errorl Rice is an attorney in St. Petersburg, Florida who represented Beach in the motion before the US federal court. Rice stated his client's motivation in requesting the ruling by Judge Merryday be rescinded was to allow Beach to recuse from the Scientology case. Rice told the St. Petersburg Times that his client's conflict with the US federal court has \"cast kind of a cloud\" over Beach's position in the Scientology case.\n\nStetson University College of Law constitutional law professor Michael Allen analyzed the clash between the US judge and Florida judge for The Tampa Tribune. Allen observed that it was \"very, very rare\" for a US federal judge to order a state judge. He noted that a 1793 federal law contravenes such orders &amp;ndash; except in \"extraordinarily narrow\" cases where the federal judges are permitted to create rulings in order to safeguard the jurisdiction of their federal court proceedings.",

After a two week battle, which reportedly left hundreds dead, the militants were dislodged from the mountain ridge Biny Baba Ziarat.\n\n\"It was very difficult to dislodge them even with the support of helicopter gunship and fighter jets,\" Brigadier Suba Khan said while speaking to assembled members of the press.\n\n\"They fought till the last men,\" added Lieutenant-Colonel Mohamed Riaz, who was credited with leading the final charge.\n\n“Essentially, at this point in time, we are looking at eliminating the hard core militants,” explained Major General Sajjad Ghani, who said that troops were closing in on another stronghold. \"The commandoes have already landed on the mountain peaks and ridges at Peochar. The militants are surrounded and encircled from all sides. They are hemmed in. And this is the right time that the security forces can go with full might and kill and eliminate the residual militants in the Peochar valley.\"\n\nThe Pakistan Army established a base at a girls' college in Khawazakhela, in part to protect it. \"The Taliban would have blown it up had we not established our base here,\" said Lt. Col. Abdul Rehman. The Taliban targeted girls’ schools and banned female education while they were in control of the Swat Valley.\n\n\"They are not Muslims despite their claims to be so,\" said Lt. Asad Hanif. \"A true Muslim cannot slaughter people like the Taliban have been doing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a car bomb which was set off at a movie theatre in Peshawar killed six people and injured at least another 75.

General Peter Chiarelli, the No. 2 ranking US general in Iraq, has made the assertion that providing jobs for the Iraqi people is key to ending the insurgency and stabilizing the country.\n\nIn a video teleconference with reporters at the Pentagon he said, \"by creating jobs and opportunity, the Iraqi government would take away a major source of support for violent movements -- aimless, underemployed, young men who would otherwise rather be gainfully employed and supporting their families, but are laying IEDs, shooting RPGs and fighting Iraqi security forces and the coalition because they lack alternatives…. In areas where unemployment is the highest, as I go out and talk to people in those areas, and they tell me the one thing that you can do to lower the number of insurgencies is find jobs for the people. And we're committed to help both the Iraqi government and the PRTs as they go about the business of doing exactly that.\"\n\nThe General also said that the insurgents were taking advantage of political disputes within the Iraqi leadership as they are attempting to form an inclusive government.\n\nChiarelli's assertion is similar to a claim made by Lt. General John R. Vines in 2005 that insurgents often attack US forces out of a desire to earn money instead of ideology. Simple tasks, such as placing a bomb or mine, are often done in exchange for amounts as little as $100 to $150.\n\nThe estimated unemployment rate in Iraq for 2005 was 25-30%.\n\nOpponents of the Bush administration's handling of the war say that Iraq's unemployment crisis is partially a result of decisions made by the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 to disband the Iraqi army and purge the Iraqi civil service of high-ranking members of the Baath Party. Both of these moves led to an estimated 500,000 Iraqis losing their jobs, about one out of every ten Iraqi workers at the time.",

The unemployment rate also rose approximately 0.4 percent, bringing the rate up to 7.6 percent (11.6 million people), the highest since January 1992. This is according to the United States Labor Department's monthly unemployment report released last week.\n\nUS President Barack Obama asked Congress today to support and quickly pass a $900 billion economic stimulus package that would, according to some, help create more jobs and decrease the unemployment rate. \"All of us in Washington must remember that we’re here to work for the American people. And if we drag our feet and fail to act, this crisis will turn into a catastrophe,\" said Obama in a statement this morning.\n\nObama warned that the rate could grow to double digits if Congress did not act fast and pass the bill allowing the package, and stated that the report was \"very troubling.\"\n\n\"These numbers demand action. It is time for Congress to act,\" he also said, \"That's 3.6 million Americans who need our help,\" he stated, referring to the number of American workers that had been laid off since the United States officially entered economic recession in December 2007.\nsource=Barack Obama\nFactories have been hit the hardest in the past month, laying off 207,000 workers, approximately 20 percent of the month's layoffs and the most by the industry since 1982. The next highest was the construction industry, which cut an estimated 110,000 workers last month. Other hard-hit industries include the financial industries, cutting 42,000 jobs, the retail industry, which cut 46,000, and leisure and hospitality, losing 28,000 workers.\n\n\"This is a horror show we’re watching. By every measure available - loss of employment and hours, rise of unemployment, shrinkage of the employment to population rate - this recession is steeper than any recession of the last 40 years, including the harsh recession of the early 1980s,\" stated Lawrence Mishel, an economist and president of the Economic Policy Institute, a US-based research organization focused on the economy. Economic forecasters reported that their predictions had actually been less severe than the report stated.\n\nThe United States Congress is currently debating a $900 billion economic stimulus bill that will attempt to halt the recession, and will continue to do so until a measure has been reached.",

    "original_text": "2020 United States presidential election\nThe following is the third edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\n\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the American Solidarity Party, the Bread and Roses Party, and the Unity Party of America.\n\nAs the campaign reached July, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden led incumbent President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.7 percent to 40.3 percent.\n\nOn July 1, the city of Seattle cleared the autonomous CHAZ/CHOP (Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone/Capitol Hill Organized Protest). Nevertheless, civil unrest including the toppling of statues, still stemming from the police killing of George Floyd in May, continued elsewhere in the US. President Trump sent Department of Homeland Security officers to protect federal buildings in Portland. Biden criticized the move, arguing Trump was \"sowing chaos and division\" and \"making matters worse.\" The Trump campaign accused Biden of \"siding with criminals.\" Trump maintained the campaign theme of law and order. While the nation continued to suffer through the coronavirus pandemic, the President traveled to South Dakota, which, unlike most states, had not enacted a stay-at-home order, to take part in a celebration at Mount Rushmore on the eve of Independence Day. He delivered a speech in which he condemned rioters who desecrate statues and memorials throughout the nation. In addition, he announced the creation of a special park with statues to honor historic US figures. Most attendees at the event did not practice social distancing or wear face masks. The next day, Trump held a Fourth of July \"Salute to America\" in Washington, D.C. in which he delivered another speech. Joe Biden forewent traditional holiday activities as an added precaution against COVID-19. That same day, rapper Kanye West made a surprise announcement on Twitter that he, himself, was running for president. In an interview with Forbes, West outlined his campaign. He named Wyoming preacher Michelle Tidball as his running mate and introduced the Birthday Party as the vehicle for his run. His platform included anti-abortion views. West backed away from his previous support for President Trump, expressing disappointment at reports Trump hid in the White House basement during riots. He leveled greater criticism at Biden, saying he was not \"special\" like himself, Trump, and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The interviewer questioned whether West was running to help President Trump defeat Biden. West did not deny the suggestion. After the interview, a spokesman for West claimed West decided to drop out of the race. However, subsequently, West officially filed with the FEC and secured a place on the ballot in Oklahoma with a US$35,000 payment. Two other Independent presidential candidates also paid the fee to qualify for the Oklahoma ballot: child actor and entrepreneur Brock Pierce; plus pianist and pageant participant Jade Simmons. West, in an interview with a Charleston, South Carolina radio station, floated Simmons as a potential running mate, arguing Tidball could be used in a different capacity. He identified fellow rapper Jay-Z as his ideal running mate. West held his first campaign rally in Charleston, where he tearfully discussed potentially aborting his first child with wife Kim Kardashian, screaming \"I almost killed my daughter!\" He proposed a US$1 million payment for those who give birth to children rather than aborting. At this time, West's family reportedly expressed concerns about West's mental state. The next day on Twitter West accused his wife of attempting to \"lock me up\" due to his comments at the rally.\n\nIn a July 9 speech in Pennsylvania, Biden introduced an economic plan called \"Build Back Better\" designed to reinvigorate the US economy in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. \"Build Back Better\" is, like Trump's \"America First\" plan, a form of economic nationalism. \"Build Back Better\" calls for an increase in corporate taxes among economic incentives to \"Buy American.\" Biden claimed the plan would create five million US jobs. Trump encouraged public schools to reopen classes in-person at summer's end. He threatened to withhold federal funds from districts that did not comply. Trump later softened his stance, acknowledging that circumstances may require delaying some school reopenings. In addition, for the first time, Trump was pictured wearing a face mask. As cases of coronavirus increased in Florida, Trump cancelled the in-person Republican National Convention planned for Jacksonville. Instead, like the Democratic National Convention Republicans opted to hold their convention in a largely virtual format. The Libertarian Party held the second half of its convention partially in-person in Orlando. Although the party had already nominated the ticket of professor Jo Jorgensen for president and podcaster Spike Cohen for vice president at the virtual convention in May, party business still needed to be completed. At the same time, the Green Party held its national convention virtually and nominated the ticket of party co-founder and union leader Howie Hawkins for president and truck driver Angela Walker for vice president.\n\nIn mid-July, Trump commuted the prison sentence of confidante Roger Stone. Stone had been found guilty of several crimes including false statements to investigators as part of Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election. Trump called Stone's 40 month sentence \"unjust.\" The Biden campaign criticized the commutation as an abuse of power, pointing to the \"ballot box\" as the only way to stop Trump. Several days later, Trump's niece Mary Trump released the tell-all book Too Much and Never Enough. The book alleges, among other things, that Trump paid his friend Joe Shapiro to take the SAT for him before his admission to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Shapiro's widow, former tennis player Pam Shriver, said her husband had told her Trump had not met Shapiro until being admitted to Wharton. The July 17 death of Democratic Congressman John Lewis, a prominent civil rights leader, had a major impact on the second half of the month. The death brought the issue of civil rights back to the forefront of the campaign. Lewis's colleague and leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, Congresswoman Karen Bass emerged as a significant contender to be Biden's running mate, joining Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Tammy Duckworth as potential candidates. Trump did not attend Lewis's viewing or funeral. Three former presidents including Barack Obama attended the funeral. During his eulogy, Obama took a veiled shot at Trump for his attacks on mail-in voting, which critics, like Obama, have said amounted to voter suppression. As the funeral progressed, Trump tweeted about possibly delaying the 2020 election due to his concerns about potential fraud from widespread mail-in balloting instituted due to the pandemic. Biden attacked Trump for the tweet, claiming he used it to distract from Lewis's funeral. In honor of Lewis, Biden said once in office he would immediately sign the renewal of the Voting Rights Act, renamed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. On the day of the funeral, the co-chair of Black Voices for Trump and 2012 presidential candidate, Herman Cain, who, like Trump, ran for president on his business credentials, died from COVID-19. He had attended Trump's Tulsa rally in June without a mask and first received hospital treatment for COVID-19 on July 1. Trump lauded Cain as a \"powerful voice of freedom.\" \n\nAs July came to a close, Biden’s lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics average slightly decreased, with Biden registering 49.9 percent to 42.1 percent for Trump. \n\nIn July, the American Solidarity Party's ticket of retired teacher Brian T. Carroll for president and high school teacher Amar Patel for vice president, qualified, through petition, for ballot access in Illinois. The party has expanded upon its ballot access from 2016 when its first ticket of Mike Maturen for president and Juan Muñoz for vice president appeared on the ballot only in Colorado, receiving a total of 6,776 votes, largely from write-ins in other states.\n\nThe party was founded in 2011 as the Christian Democratic Party. It changed to its current name ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The party is based on Roman Catholic social teachings, advocating for social justice, environmentalism, and \"a consistent life ethic\"\nincluding opposition to abortion, euthanasia, and capital punishment. It has grown ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\nLast September the party nominated Carroll for president over past Wikinews interviewee Joe Schriner and Joshua Perkins who also sought the party's nomination. Carroll selected Patel as his running mate. Patel, the son of Indian immigrants, is a high school teacher in the Chicago suburbs. He converted to Catholicism in 1993 and engaged with the Knights of Columbus. He became involved in the pro-life movement and, in association with that, the Republican Party, but grew disillusioned with the party over the war policies of the George W. Bush administration. Eventually, Patel joined the Solidarity Party and rose to the position of chairman\n\nPatel spoke with Wikinews about the campaign. He discussed how he became the vice presidential nominee of the Solidarity Party, what he sees as his duties and responsibilities as Carroll's running mate, and why voters should consider voting for the Carroll/Patel ticket.\n\nWSS Why did you agree to be the running mate of Brian Carroll? How do you complement him on the ticket?\n::Patel: I was already serving the second and final year of my term on the National Committee and was the party chair when Brian asked me to run with him. I would have essentially done the same thing I did until the end of June whether I was running for office or not. This basically continued my service as a party leader through November and I welcomed the opportunity to have a heightened awareness to our message for a few more months. I complement Brian by being the quick take provider on Twitter while he is long form prose producer on Facebook.\n\nWSS What duties and responsibilities come with being the vice presidential nominee of the Solidarity Party?\n::Patel: Technically there are no official duties or responsibilities besides filling in and signing the required paperwork to get on various ballots or become write-in candidates. I have taken on the responsibility of creating memes and videos for us to promote the party message but also the short term campaign message.\n\nWSS In what states is the Carroll/Patel ticket expected to be on the ballot? Why should voters in those states choose Carroll/Patel over other tickets?\n::Patel: We will be on the ballot in my home state of Illinois, Vermont, Wisconsin, Colorado, Louisiana, Arkansas, Rhode Island, Washington, Mississippi, and perhaps a few others.\n::There is no other campaign that clearly states that government will necessarily continue to grow as long as #FamilyFriendsFaith erode. Those institutions teach us self control and responsibility for others. If you primarily concern yourself with selfishness, the state has to provide the constraints that you do not. If you believe rights and responsibilities must be balanced vote Carroll/Patel 2020.\n\nThe Bread and Roses Party ticket of University of Maryland research scholar Jerome Segal for president and filmmaker John de Graaf for vice president secured a spot on the ballot in Vermont in July. The party had already achieved qualified status in Maryland. It is seeking access only in non-swing states where a particular major party is heavily expected to win. In swing states, to avoid the spoiler effect, the party supports the Democratic Party's presidential ticket. \n\nSegal founded the Bread and Roses Party since the last presidential election. Its name derives from the rallying call of immigrant textile workers in Massachusetts during a 1912 strike. The party holds leftist positions including the right to employment, paid vacation, a shortened work week, and recognition of the State of Palestine. In August 2019 the party nominated Segal for president. He announced de Graaf as his running mate this past April. As a filmmaker, de Graaf has produced 40 documentaries. In addition, he has co-written four books, and has written numerous articles for such publications as The Progressive and The New York Times.\n\nWith Wikinews, de Graaf discusses why he joined the Bread and Roses Party, what his role as vice presidential nominee entails, and why voters in non-swing states should choose the Segal/de Graaf ticket over other options on the ballot.\n\nWSSWhy did you decide to run as the vice presidential nominee of the Bread and Roses Party? How do you complement Jerome Segal on the ticket?\n\n::de Graaf: I was asked by Jerome to be his Bread and Roses Party running mate and considered it an honor as I have been advocating for its principles for half a century. We believe that quality of life is more important than quantity of money or goods, and that our national priorities of economic growth, worship of the stock market and constant tax cutting to fuel mindless consumption both threaten the life systems of the planet and ignore the importance of \"the roses\" in our lives &amp;mdash; such things as nature, natural beauty and smart human design, the arts, social connection, good health, and especially enough leisure time to actually enjoy the fruits of our prodigious labors.\n\n::We come out of the \"voluntary simplicity\" movement of resistance to consumerism but understand that living simply and ecologically is not solely a personal choice. We need policies that make it easier for people to earn a modest but secure income without working themselves to death or producing for the sake of production rather than the satisfactions that meaningful work, human connections and a beautiful environment can bring us.\n\n::Jerome has also been a longtime advocate of Middle East peace and justice for Palestinians with a two-state solution in Israel. We support that, and a massive reduction in nuclear weapons and arms buildups in the interest of world peace. Our priorities as a country are simply out of whack and we want to make that point and offer a different vision of the good life.\n\n::I complement Jerome in that while he is an academic and a scholar I am a filmmaker and communicator who has spent forty years making documentaries for PBS about quality of life issues.\n\nWSSWhat duties and responsibilities do you have as the vice presidential nominee of the Bread and Roses Party?\n\n::de Graaf: At this point, only to help get the word out as we are under no illusions of winning. Our goal is educational and we hope that our key concepts &amp;mdash; guaranteed jobs or income that allow for a modest but secure life and a Beauty New Deal (to complement the Green New Deal which we also support), will be picked up by candidates and leaders in the major parties. Of course, we hardly expect the GOP to take us seriously but we know many Democrats share our values and will be inspired by our proposals.\n\n::We'd love to see a Bread and Roses caucus in the Democratic Party &amp;mdash; we agree with its calls for greater equality, climate action, racial justice, compassion and kindness. We also believe it should pay attention to the \"roses\" and should work hard to reduce international tensions. We will continue to campaign for these ideas both as a third party and within the Democratic Party.\n\nWSSIn what states should voters expect to see the Segal/de Graaf ticket on the ballot? Why should voters choose the Segal/de Graaf ticket over other tickets on the ballot?\n\n::de Graaf: COVID-19 has made it very difficult to collect the signatures to get on the ballot in many states and you will only see us on the ballot this year in Maryland, where Jerome lives, and Vermont. We are not seeking to be spoilers and had no intention of running in any state where we might in any way cause the defeat of Joe Biden as we believe the most important thing right now is to end the monstrosity of the Trump presidency.\n\n::We see Vermont and Maryland as among the bluest states in the union, where it is also possible that some on the Left will sit the election out, knowing that a Biden victory is assured in their state. Instead, we hope they will come out and vote for us and then for other progressives further down the ticket. If we get enough votes to be noticed we hope we can create a new dialogue about the importance of the roses in political thinking.\n\n::In other safe Blue States or deeply Red ones, voters can write us in to send a message about quality of life. As we emerge from Covid-19, we do not want to return to the old normal of a grossly unequal, overworked America, obsessed with materialistic values at the expense of our environment, health and happiness. I hope people who read this will check out our webpage and our Facebook page. below.\n\nThe Unity Party of America ticket of Internet entrepreneur Bill Hammons for president and engineer Eric Bodenstab for vice president secured ballot access in New Jersey in late July. The party had already attained ballot access in Colorado as a qualified minor party with at least 1,000 members. This is the first election cycle the party has fielded a presidential ticket.\n\nHammons founded the Unity Party in 2004 and grew it through his 2008 and 2010 runs for US Congress, his 2014 and 2016 runs for US Senate, and his 2018 run for Governor of Colorado. The party, which describes itself as centrist, advocates in its constitution for, among other things, a balanced budget amendment, elimination of the federal income tax, tax deduction for health care costs, a global minimum wage for fair trade, term limits for Congress and judges, lowering the voting age, DC statehood, and expanded space exploration.\n\nBodenstab has previously run for city council and was the Unity Party's nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Colorado in 2018. With Wikinews, Bodenstab discusses how he joined the Unity Party's presidential ticket, what constitutes his role as the party's vice presidential nominee, and why voters in the states the party has attained ballot access should consider casting their vote for the Hammons/Bodenstab ticket.\n\nWSS: Why did you join Bill Hammons on the Unity Party's 2020 presidential ticket? How do you complement him on the ticket?\n\n::Bodenstab: I joined Mr. Hammons on the ballot because it was time to expand the party nationally. We had just appeared on the ballot together in 2018, and by December it was clear that we were going to field a presidential candidate. That person was myself. Bill, for all his effort since 2004, probably needed to have someone else drive. In addition, there was plenty to do at the state level here in Colorado. When COVID-19 hit, I lost my job and it made sense to pass the baton back.\n\nWSS: What duties and responsibilities come with being the vice presidential nominee of the Unity Party?\n\n::Bodenstab: Our duties are very widespread. From fundraising to finding candidates to talking with voters &amp;mdash; we are candidates and field coordinators at the same time. I was just in Louisiana last weekend personally seeking 8 electors for our presidential ballot. Despite having in-laws in that state, we didn't have much of a network there, so Bill and I both were building it at the grassroots level.\n\n::After we engaged and enrolled 8 individuals, spread across the 6 districts, Bill headed back to Tennessee to finish our ballot access there. Our time in Louisiana took us to Eunice, a small town of no more than 10,000. After finding our elector there (in CD 4), we met a young woman who was helping us find our last elector in Baton Rouge. In passing, I let it be known that I was in the engineering field. She was clearly more excited by that, than us being presidential candidates. Such is the nature of our campaign, but I wouldn't have it any other way. People should be excited by us being ordinary citizens rather than rich and powerful lawmakers.\n\nWSS: In what states should voters expect to see the Hammons/Bodenstab ticket on the ballot? Why should these voters consider casting their vote for the Hammons/Bodenstab ticket over the other tickets on the ballot?\n\n::Bodenstab: As I have mentioned, we traveled to Louisiana and Tennessee this last month. We anticipate being on the ballot there, as well as in New Jersey (which is confirmed and reported, how you heard about us).\n\n::We have demonstrated that just a couple guys, with the peripheral help of several others, can take a big step personally on behalf of the party we founded some years ago. I don't think any of the other candidates can boast that. Jo Jorgensen, from what I understand, has also worked tirelessly on ballot access for the Liberty party. But she cannot claim she founded a party. With all due respect, there is something incredibly special about that.",

    "original_text": "Much discussion has been garnered over a massive 200 yard spider web discovered in Lake Tawakoni State Park, Eastern Texas, United States.\n\nThe web is stretched across a 200 yard section of a nature trail in the park, covering the ground, bushes and even seven sizeable trees.\n\nDonna Garde, superintendent at the park, described the web and its effectiveness: \"At first, it was so white it looked like fairyland. Now it's filled with so many mosquitos that it's turned a little brown. There are times you can literally hear the screech of millions of mosquitoes caught in those webs.\"\n\nMike Quinn, an invertebrate biologist with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, described a high level of interest in the web: \"I've been hearing from entomologists sic from Ohio, Kansas, British Columbia, all over the place.\" It was Quinn who originally posted images of the web on the internet, sparking the intense interest.\n\nThere is much debate amongst experts over the reasons for the web's construction, with some believing it was created by social spiders living as a colony, and others suggesting it is possibly a system of mass dispersal, with the spiders building webs in order to spread out. There is also uncertainty over the species of spider responsible, although it is known that smaller webs of an otherwise similar nature have been discovered elsewhere in the park, on another trail. It is thought that the species is likely a member of the genus Tetragnatha.\n\nJohn Jackman, a professor and extension entomologist for Texas A&amp;M University and author of A Field Guide to the Spiders and Scorpions of Texas, said that the phenomenon is not particularly unusual and that reports are submitted to him every few years detailing similar webs. \"There are a lot of folks that don't realize spiders do that,\" Jackman said. \"Until we get some samples sent to us, we really won't know what species of spider we're talking about.\"\n\nHowever, other experts disagree over the unusual nature of the discovery. \"From what I'm hearing, it could be a once-in-a-lifetime event,\" said Herbert \"Joe\" Pase, a Texas Forest Service entomologist. \"It's very, very unusual.\"\n\nThe web is expected to begin to disintegrate soon, as the spiders die out over Autumn. \"It would make a good Halloween set, wouldn't it?\" said park ranger Freddie Gowin, who found the giant web while mowing last month. However, it is not anticipated to survive until October 31st.",

    "original_text": "New Zealand\nThe New Zealand government today has announced that they will not provide financial assistance to the Overlander train service between Auckland and Wellington, which is set to stop service on September 30, if no assistance is forthcoming. ONTRACK will retain the North Island main trunk line, while looking for tourism operators to start a tourist rail service.\n\nTrevor Mallard, acting Finance Minister, said: \"In making this decision... Cabinet recognised that there was no prospect of the current Overlander service becoming commercially viable. It was not a fuel-efficient operation and at an average passenger rate of 50 passengers each way per day, it was used by relatively few people.\"\n\nIt is cheaper and faster to travel either by bus or plane rather than the 12-hour train journey. \"The fares already overlap with airfares, and the reality is that the service is just not well-used. It can not compete with low-priced air travel and coaches. Cabinet considered the regional implications of ceasing the Overlander service and accepted that the current bus services run by the InterCity Group met the needs of those communities,\" Mallard said.\n\nThere has been numerous petitions from the public and from the Green Party of New Zealand to continue the Overlander train service, including one petition signed by 16,000 people presented at the Parliament Buildings on September 14, 2006. \"While there have been a number of propositions about retaining the Overlander service, all of the propositions would require government funding in one form or another,\" said Mallard.\n\nMallard said that the government will only support rail services if it significantly benefitted the community.\n\nThe Government estimates that financial assistance to the Overlander train service would cost NZ$1.75 million a year.\n\n\"Finally, the government does recognise and value the importance of a viable and efficient rail network in New Zealand's transport infrastructure. This was a critical factor in the government's decision to buy the rail network back from Tranz Rail. The government has also committed $200 million to upgrade the national rail network between 2004/05 and 2007/08. A further $600 million has been provided to upgrade the Auckland rail network between 2005/06 and 2009/10.\"",

    "original_text": "After seven weeks in the Southern Ocean disrupting the Japanese whaling fleet, a Canadian registered anti-whaling ship, the Farley Mowat, has been detained by South African authorities.\n\nThe Sea Shepherd Conservation Society vessel, its captain Paul Watson, and his crew, have been detained indefinitely. The South African Maritime Safety Authority (SAMSA) have placed a guard on the gangplank and are patrolling the ship.\n\nThe Farley Mowat, which sailed from Melbourne, Australia on December 6, was detained in Cape Town harbour, following a request from the Canadian government. A SAMSA official said the ship did not have the required certification.\n\n\"They don't have the right certificates for the skipper, the first-mate or the chief engineer,\" an official said. According to SAMSA, the detention adheres to Canadian maritime laws and followed correspondence from Canada, who requested that the authorities check the ship.\n\nAccording to Scoop Independent, the ship and crew have been detained due to the International Maritime Organization's ISPS Code. Under Canadian maritime law, both the captain and first officer should be Canadian nationals. Captain Paul Watson is Canadian, First Officer Alex Cornelissen is Dutch.\n\nSAMSA claims that the Farley Mowat was not in possession of an international ship security certificate or a ship security plan.\n\nThis means the ship allegedly does not comply with the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code) &amp;mdash; a comprehensive set of measures to enhance the security of ships and port facilities. The code was developed in response to the perceived maritime threats to ships and port facilities in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in the United States.\n\nThe official said the detention was in line with Canadian maritime laws and followed correspondence from Canada requesting the authorities check the ship.\n\nHowever, Captain Paul Watson says political pressure from Japan is behind the detention of the boat. He says he does not have the necessary documentation required by officials as the boat is registered as a yacht and not a commercial vessel.\n\nJapanese whalers are currently in the Antarctic catching whales for the Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR)'s JARPA II lethal research program - a practice condemned internationally by anti-whaling nations. After samples have been taken, the remaining whale meat is sold as a delicacy.\n\nDuring the last six weeks in Antarctica, the Farley Mowat has intercepted the Japanese whaling fleet, chasing the whalers over 4,000 miles. Sea Shepherd say the whalers spent 15 days running from them, and that \"no whales were killed as the fleet attempted to put as much distance between the whalers and whale defenders as possible.\"\n\nDuring one confrontation the Farley Mowat crew claim it sideswiped the Japanese whaling fleet supply vessel Oriental Bluebird and ordered it to leave from the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.\n\nSea Shepherd Conservation Society say they will return to Antarctica in December 2006 with a faster long-range vessel. \"We discovered that when we can catch them, we could stop their whaling activities. If we can secure a faster ship we will be able to shut them down completely. We will be making every effort to secure a faster ship so that we can return and intervene more effectively against their illegal killing operations,\" said Captain Paul Watson.\n\nInstitute of Cetacean Research in Tokyo councilor Dan Goodman say that Australia, New Zealand, and other anti-whaling nations should support Japan's commitment to its scientific research.\n\nJapan announced at last year's meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) this summer its JARPA II program that includes the killing of 935 Minke whales and 10 endangered Fin whales.\n\nIn 2007-08, Japan will raise its self-imposed kill quotas to include 935 Minke whales, 50 fin whales, and 50 Humpbacks whales. Mr. Goodman said Japan had to kill the whales because certain kinds of data – including how old whale populations are, how old whales are when they reach sexual maturity, how long whales live for, and what they eat – cannot be obtained using non-lethal methods.\n\n\"These are the kinds of data required to improve management measures for the resumption of commercial whaling,\" Mr. Goodman said. \"Of course the anti-whaling scientists don't believe this kind of data is required because they do not want to see a resumption of commercial whaling.\"\n\nDr Gales, head of Australia's delegation to the scientific committee for the IWC, said after years of research the Japanese should have concluded by now that piked (minke) whales eat krill. \"They're asking for support for science that has no support,\" he said.\n\nNext year, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society say they intend to return to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in Antarctica to do some research of their own; \"We need to research more effective law enforcement measures to shut down this criminal operation that is posing as a research project,\" said Captain Watson.",

Police will not release details about the assault.\n\nNeil Havens Rodreick II, 29, is a convicted sex-offender who is from Oklahoma and police arrested Rodreick when he attempted to enroll into Mingus Springs Charter School located in Chino Valley, Arizona using what school officials thought to be fake documents. Rodreick spent nearly the whole day at the school. Rodreick also attended another charter school from August 14 to November of 2006, Imagine School at Rosefield.

Two reasons: 1) The week before last, my U.S. Representative announced that he would not seek re-election; and 2) After Super Tuesday, the viability of conducting an independent petition drive for president became impossible; especially since my choice for running mate, Dr. Ron Paul, effectively announced last week that he was not interested in working outside of the Republican Party.\n\nHe says that he has always intended on running for the position, no matter whether the incumbent was returning or not.\n\nJust weeks ago, Zilaitis told television reporters from Central Florida News 13 that \"I actually believe -- and I have no choice but to believe -- that I can be the next 44th president of the United States of America.\"\n\nPreviously, in 2006, Zilaitis ran for circuit judge in Group 20 of the 18th Judicial Circuit, in Florida's Seminole and Brevard counties.\n\nAt least three more Central Florida remain, and there are apparently 30 Floridians seeking the White House altogether.",

    "original_text": "Zimbabwe\nInflation in Zimbabwe is now the world's highest at 11,000 percent and rising. Reports first came in that the value of the Zimbabwean dollar had reached an all-time low two days ago, at which point the official inflation rate was 4,500 percent. Even though this was already high enough to be the world's highest, to make matters worse, independent financial sources estimated the figure to be closer to 9,000 percent. Yesterday, reports came in that inflation had risen to 11,000 percent.\n\nUS Ambassador to Zimbabwe Christopher Dell is reported to have told The Guardian newspaper over the telephone that he believes inflation \"will hit 1.5 million percent by the end of 2007, if not before,\" adding that he \"know(s) that sounds stratospheric but, looking at the way things are going, I believe it is a modest forecast.\" Dell went on to predict that president Robert Mugabe would be forced out of power by the hyperinflation, a prediction also made by opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\nDell added that he felt Mugabe would be out in \"a matter of months, if not weeks\" and justified his comments with the rationale that \"It destabilises everything. People have completely lost faith in the currency and that means they have completely lost faith in the government that issues it.\" Tsvangirai comments to the Associated Press were that: \"He's got an economy that's down on its knees, he knows he cannot sustain it.\" Despite this, Mugabe has expressed intentions to stand for the next election.\n\nExchange rates for the U.S. dollar have reached an official 15,000-1, but on the black market, according to one anonymous illicit money trader, deals have reached 140,000-1 in cash, with a shortage of bank notes creating a 200,000-1 premium on bank transfers and large overseas deals reaching as much as 300,000-1. Meanwhile, in the course of a week the black market exchange for the UK£ has risen from 160,000-1 to 400,000-1. Despite these increases, Mugabe remains adamant that his currency should not be devalued, and is keeping official exchange rates fixed, with the rate for the US$ fixed at 250-1.\n\nThe dealer said that added uncertainty had arisen from talks held between the current government and the opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. The official press services published propaganda describing the talks as the opposition negotiating \"in bad faith\" for its own political gain.\n\nShops are running out of goods due to the huge cost of imported goods and the lack of local ones due to the closure of inflation-crippled factories. \"If it goes on like this, we'll have nothing to sell, we'll have no staff and we'll have to close down completely,\" said one store manager, who was unnamed because he feared retaliation by the state for being a \"prophet of doom\". Other shops have been closing down temporarily to change their prices.\n\nHyperinflation is also worsening already crippling poverty in Zimbabwe, with people unable to afford the necessary goods for survival. State regulations limit bank money withdrawals to Z$1.5 million per day, hopelessly inadequate given current currency values. One person's pension company informed him he would no longer receive statements because the value of his pension fund had decreased to less than that of a postage stamp.\n\nThe state daily Chronicle in the second city of Bulawayo reported that Western countries were planning to become involved with the situation upon Mugabe's departure with a rescue package valued at US$3 billion. Western officials have confirmed that budget proposals exist relating to, according to the Associated Press, \"food support, public services reform and the rebuilding of agriculture and general infrastructure over five years in a new political landscape led by reformist Zimbabwean politicians.\" However, state media again ran propaganda-based stories, saying that Western powers and their close political friends, who state media call the \"Fishmongers Group\", were \"working overtime to destroy the economy, mutilate the Zimbabwe dollar, foment civil unrest and then dangle a rescue package to win the support of gullible politicians.\"",

Negotiators plan to discuss how the treaty will be upheld at Copenhagen.

Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu Rubina, alias Txeroki (English: Cherokee), was arrested along with a woman who has not been named.\n\nHe was arrested in a joint operation by Spanish and French police. He is being held in France in connection with the killing of two Spanish Civil Guards in Capbreton, France, December 1, 2007.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero said, \"Today Eta is weaker and Spanish democracy is stronger.\"\n\n\"The arrest shows the unfailing determination of the police forces in the battle against any form of terrorism. It also illustrates once again the admirable collaboration between France and Spain in the fight against Basque terrorism,\" read a statement from French Interior Minister Michèle Alliot-Marie's office.\n\nThe ETA organization is blamed by authorities for the deaths of 820 people since it began campaigning for a separate Basque state in the 1960s.\n\nAccording to CNN, Txeroki is thought to have joined the ETA in 2000, rising to become the military chief in 2004.",

The two were charged with attempting to smuggle 8.3 kg of heroin from Bali to Australia.\n\nThe Australian Federal Police have been criticised for allowing the Bali Nine to travel to Indonesia, where it was known they could face the death penalty.

Chan was alleged to be the mastermind of the operation, and Myuran was alleged to be an enforcer.

    "original_text": "Science and technology\n\nOn Sunday, China announced the attachment of the final panel to its telescope named Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). This piece marks the end of a five-year-long US$180 million (CNY¥1.2 billion) construction project.\n\nFAST comprises about 4,500 panels and spans a diameter of 500 meters (about 1640 feet). The telescope is part of a series of ventures into space exploration by China, including planning another robotic Moon mission and creating a Chinese space station, with its core module set to be launched into space in 2018. With the country's founding centenary coming in 2049, Chinese President Xi Jinping said during a Beijing conference, \"great scientific and technological capacity is a must for China to be strong\".\n\nIn order to achieve optimal electromagnetic performance for FAST with minimal signal interference, it was built in the South China Karst. This ultimately forced the relocation of about 9,100 inhabitants within a 3.1-mile (5km) radius of the telescope. The residents received about US$1,800 (CNY¥12,000) in reimbursement, with those experiencing difficulties with housing receiving about US$1,500 (CNY¥10,000) in extra compensation. The Chinese government supports the resettlement, with senior party official Li Yuecheng saying the relocation would provide a \"sound electromagnetic wave environment\".\n\nThe telescope is now the largest-diameter single-dish radio telescope. It took the spot from the 305-meter diameter Arecibo Observatory telescope in Puerto Rico. Russia's RATAN-600 multi-element radio telescope has a diameter of 576 meters. This adds to China's record-defying achievements; it contains the world's largest bridge and the world's longest wall, the Great Wall of China.\n\nThe telescope is set to be ready for use in September. Its possible uses include exploration for pulsars, a special type of neutron stars detected through their emission of radio pulses. Scientists have also described the telescope's potential to explore alien civilization, with NAO Radio Astronomy Technology Laboratory director Peng Bo saying FAST's \"potential to discover an alien civilization will be 5 to 10 times that of current equipment, as it can see farther and darker planets\".",

The operation began the previous Saturday when Pakistani forces approached from three separate areas of South Waziristan. Pakistan plans to trap Taliban within the area while approaching the towns of Makeen and Ladha, both of which are major Taliban strongholds.\n\nMajor General Athar Abbas, the chief spokesman for the military, said at a news briefing that \"we have complete control of Kotkai, a stronghold of the terrorists, where most of the houses had been converted into strong bunkers. This is a very important development tactically.\"\n\nSo far, Pakistani officials have reported that 163 militants have been killed, while the military sustained 23 casualties. However, there was no independent confirmation for the tolls.\n\nThe entire area has been closed off, but there have been recent acts of violence which have officials worried. In recent weeks, Pakistan has seen attacks on police centers, military headquarters and a UN building. There have also been five attacks on an Islamic university in Islamabad, the capital.\n\nIt has been reported that over 21,000 civilian families, an estimated 153,000 individuals, have fled South Waziristan, and have taken refuge in the North-West Frontier Province.",

Other alleged leaders, including national chairman Enrique Tarrio, have entered not guilty pleas on charges of seditious conspiracy. According to prosecutors, they were members of an elite group of leaders called the \"Ministry of Self Defense\" and hand-picked by Tarrio.\n\nProsecutors' filings also said Donohoe supplied the Proud Boys with radio transmitters, so they could communicate before and during the 2021 attack on the Capitol. Tarrio was arrested two days before the riot. Immediately after Tarrio's arrest, Donohoe deleted the group's messages on the Telegram communication platform and messaged that plans might be compromised. \"Well at least they won't get our boots on the ground plan because we are one step ahead of them,\" he wrote in a follow-up.\n\nDonohoe reportedly never entered the Capitol, even though he was in the first wave of people descending upon the building, as he was overcome by pepper spray. Nevertheless, his assault charges stemmed from throwing two water bottles at Capitol Police officers. He allegedly also sent messages stating: \"We stormed the capitol unarmed &amp;hellip; we took it over.\"\n\nThe assault on the Capitol took place while Congress was certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election won by Joe Biden. The Proud Boys were in favor of a second term for former president Donald Trump.",

    "original_text": "Until a patch is issued, Microsoft recommends that users close or block TCP port 3389, the port opened when the Remote Assistance service of its Microsoft Windows operating system (OS) is enabled. The Remote Assistance feature is a service of the OS that allows Internet Technology administrators of corporate workgroups remote access to other desktops to perform maintenance and other configuration tasks from their own computer. It can also be used by on-line tech support sites. A support assistant can go into a user’s machine, if the service is enabled, and themself make changes directly to another person's computer to resolve an issue.\n\nTo initialize the remote assistance feature, the user of the helper computer must first make a request of the user of the target computer. Compliance must be granted by the user of the target machine, which then fully opens the communication port of the target machine to the helper computer. The operator of the helper computer then has control of target computer to make changes at will. The user of the target machine can watch in a separate window the actions of the helper, and either party to the session can end it at any time.\n\nIn a telephone conversation with a Microsoft representative Tuesday, it was learned that work to develop a security patch is underway, but when it will be available is unclear. It was cited that a patch must work consistently across multiple platform versions of the OS.\n\nThe vulnerability, thought at first to affect only Windows XP SP2, is now believed to affect all current Windows editions, including Windows 2000, Windows XP SP1, Windows XP Professional x64, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 SP1, and Windows Server x64.\n\nThe Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is not enabled by default, however if the service is enabled, a Denial of Service attack could cause the OS to restart unexpectedly according to Microsoft, or experience buffer overflows according to Symantec. The RDP is enabled by default on Windows XP Media Center Edition.\n\nMicrosoft suggests users block TCP port 3389 (the port used by RDP) on their firewall, or disable Terminal Services or Remote Desktop if not required by the user. The remote desktop connections could also be secured using either Internet Protocol Security or a virtual private network connection until a patch is ready.\n\nTo disable Remote Assistance on a Windows XP Edition, the steps are:\n# click 'Start', right-click 'My Computer', select 'Properties'\n# select 'Remote' tab on top of the 'Systems Properties' window, clear checkbox that says \"Allow Remote Assistance invitations to be sent from this computer.\"\n# click 'Apply' button\n\nThe group, Internet Storm Center, detected spikes in scanning for port 3389 beginning July 6. Larger numbers of systems scanned were reported on July 13. Crackers may be scanning for vulnerable machines, the group said.\n\n\"It's a kernel vulnerability,\" said VP of engineering for Symantec Alfred Huger, \"so it will be difficult to exploit reliably. But he the original discoverer found the vulnerability with a commonly-used tool, so if he can find it, so can others. I don't think it will turn it into a large-scale worm, but then, some kernel vulnerabilities have ended up as just that, like the Witty worm.\"",

McGuire, who had also been consuming alcohol and drugs at the time, attacked Kearins during the argument. \"It was Mr McGuire who started the fight and you were subjected to a quite serious assault,\" the judge said.\n\nDuring the fight, Kearins took hold of a knife from the kitchen of the Shettleston Road flat and stabbed McGuire through his heart, causing him to collapse. The judge commented on how Kearins \"expressed remorse at the scene\". The court was told that as McGuire was dying of his injuries, Kearins said: \"Don't die.

Derrick Nelson, the defence counsel, said Kearins \"has always accepted responsibility for stabbing Mr McGuire. He is remorseful for what he did.\"\n\nAs well as the eight year prison imprisonment, judge Lady Scott also sentenced Kearins to a four month supervision order after his release from prison as she considered him a public threat.

The drones were found to deliver their cargo in usable condition after flights lasting almost half an hour, at distances of up to 12 miles.\n\n\"For rural areas that lack access to nearby clinics, or that may lack the infrastructure for collecting blood products or transporting them on their own, drones can provide that access,\" says pathologist and lead author of the paper Dr. Timothy Amukele.\n\nAlthough earlier studies have confirmed that drone flights do not affect the useful properties or microbe populations of human blood products, those experiments were performed on small, vial-sized samples. Here, the drones carried much larger quantities of blood, in the proportions and packaging that doctors and medical technicians would actually use on patients, with units purchased directly from the American Red Cross. Unlike Rwanda's medical delivery drones, which were custom-made for blood product delivery by Zipline, these experiments were completed with regular, commercially available S900-model machines with minimal modification.\n\nPost-flight, the samples were tested for cell rupture, changes in pH, air bubbles and other damage that might indicate that the packages had thawed out or otherwise become unsuitable for use in transfusions. The samples were found to have arrived intact.\n\nAlthough the test was performed in an unpopulated area, it is speculated that drones might be useful not only for delivery of blood products to rural medical facilities but also for distributing blood resources through urban areas. John's Hopkins pathologist and research team leader Dr. Timothy Armukele speculates that emergency medical teams may one day be able to transfuse patients on the spot by calling for a drone to bring blood of the appropriate type.\n\nThe details of the experiment have been published in the latest issue of Transfusion.",

After he was laid off by the station last year due to a change in programing, he was working as a freelance reporter for ABC News Radio, a national network. In his career before WABC, he worked for KTLK and KMPC, located in Los Angeles, California and KGO in San Francisco, California.\n\n\"We are shocked and deeply saddened by the death of our colleague and friend George Weber, who was the victim of what police have deemed a homicide at his home in Brooklyn. An investigation has been launched by NYPD and we have been assisting them. Our condolences and prayers go out to George's family and friends at this very difficult time. He really loved news radio and enjoyed being on the air and enjoyed the connection he had with his listeners. He also loved Brooklyn and his neighborhood,\" said Steve Jones, the vice president of ABC News Radio in a statement released to the media.\n\nCurrently, the NYPD thinks that Weber was killed Friday while in bed. They are looking into the possibility that he was stabbed to death by a date, as there were no signs of a break-in into the apartment, and the front door was locked. The NYPD could not retrieve the weapon used in the homicide.\n\n\"News ran through his veins and arteries 24 hours a day. He wasn't a rip-and-read newsman. He wanted to be there,\" said Curtis Sliwa, who worked with Weber as a co-host at WABC, \"And you know what his trick was? He'd pack up his dog, Noodles, a dachshund, and walk him there. People would see the dog, they'd pet the dog, they'd get a level of comfort with him. And then he could get them to talk.\"",

Ahn revealed the promise in a campaign book released this Monday. This follows over a decade of active legislation requiring banking websites to use a South Korean ActiveX technology to operate digital certificates.\n\nSouth Korea developed the ActiveX certificates technology in the late 1990s with an expectation of worldwide adoption, which did not happen. ActiveX has been supported only by Microsoft's Internet Explorer web browser. Ahn indicated disadvantages of the technology, writing that \"South Korea's unique certificate system, driven by the government, has led to the isolation of South Korea's IT information technology. Excessive use of Active X is making web browsing less convenient.\"\n\nSome commenters noted that the technology requires users to install multiple plugins for Microsoft Internet Explorer, which cause a decrease in overall computer performance.

The AusLink program is to receive an additional 2.3 billion, an \"increase of nearly 20 percent\", and noted that the Budget would allocate \"800 million to accelerate duplication of...the Hume Highway\", and \"270 million dollars to RailTrack\" in the development of the north-south rail corridor.\n\nCostello noted the Government's commitment to the health of the Murray River system by a \"new injection of 500 millions to the Murray-Darling basin commission\" for a \"range of capital works and improvements\".\n\nCostello also announced funding for health and medical research, noting an increase in funding for the NHMRC to a base funding of 700 million dollars a year, a \"fivefold increase\", sixty-five additional fellowships for researchers, and 235 million dollars for \"physical infrastructure\".\n\nCostello announced in regard to tax reform a \"new comprehensive tax reform plan\" \"another installment in income tax reform\", a \"major improvement in business tax\" and a \"plan to simplify and streamline superannuation\" \"most significant change in nearly 20 years\"\n\nCostello remarked that if one could reduce the tax burden, one \"should aim to do so\", and thus announced he would \"reduce marginal tax rates\" at the other end of income tax scale, and would increase tax-free thresholds.\n\nOn superannuation reform, Costello proposed to \"sweep away the current raft of complexity\" and \"increase retirement incomes\". The core of the plan is the \"proposal to exempt Australians age 60 or over from any tax\" on particular superannuation arrangements.\n\nCostello announced changes in family assistance payments. The Family Tax Benefit payment is now available to those earning under AUD$40,000. The limit on the number of subsidised after school hour places would be removed.\n\nFurthermore, Costello noted that \"an additional 1000 to be paid this financial year to over 1000 people eligible for the carer payment\".\n\nCostello announced that 10.7 billion dollars would be allocated to the Australian Defence Force, and announced 2.2 billion would be spent to acquire C-17 heavy lift aircraft.\n\nOn intelligence, Costello announced an increase ASIO staffing to 1800 and improvements to its technical capabilities, and a further 125 million to enable increased operations for ASIO.\n\nCostello also said that 389 million dollars would be allocated over four years to combat illegal fishing.\n\nCostello concluded by forecasting that Australia's economy would grow to a \"trillion dollar economy\" and that the Budget would \"build opportunities for the future\".\n\nProcessing of accompanying bills then begun by Parliament.\n\nThe Federal Australian Labor Party Opposition will have a right-of-reply tomorrow.",

Current premier and leader of the ALP Anna Bligh will be, if Labor wins, the first female to elected premier in Australian history. Ms Bligh became the third female premier in Australian history when Peter Beattie resigned in 2007.\n\nThe premier has received criticism from other parties for backflipping on its commitment to run a full term. \"After 11 years in office, Ms Bligh only cares about one job: her own,\" said Lawrence Springborg head of the Liberal National Party (LNP) and the Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThe Liberal National Party is currently in opposition. It is seen as a prototype for a national merger between the Liberal and National parties. The Opposition need to pick up at least twenty seats from the government to overcome the significant Labor majority and a number of independents.\n\nThe Queensland Greens are the states largest minor party. The Greens unveiled its policy to open two solar power stations on the weekend of January 31/February 1.\n\n\"We can tackle climate change and create long-term jobs, but Labor can't see that because they are blinded by the interests of their big donors - the urban development and coal industries,\" said Mt Coo-tha candidate Larrisa Waters.\n\nThe Greens main policies have been stated \"Green collar jobs\", \"managing where the money is going\", education and transport.\n\n\"The Greens want to give the community and the environment a voice back in State Parliament,\" says Ms Waters.\n\nThe Socialist Alliance will run two candidates as independents because of what they call \"restrictive rules for registration.\"\n\nWikinews conducted an interview with the Socialist Alliance on March 2rd in which they said, \"That choosing between \"tweedledee\" and \"tweedledum\" once every few years is not real democracy, and with the planet in peril, facing an economic meltdown, and all manner of social problems, we can't afford to leave sociaety sic in the hands of the pro-corporate parties.\"\n\nThe Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4EQ) party was set up in late 2008. DS4SEQ leader Jason Furze gave an interview to Wikinews in January. \"DS4SEQ would like to gain a sizeable percentage of the primary vote and win a number of seats,\" Mr furze said.

The move comes after Cadbury's board recommended accepting a takeover bid by United States firm Kraft that valued the company at £11.9 billion sterling.\n\nFerrero is best known for its Rocher branded chocolates and the advertisements that accompany them. It had been rumoured that the Italians would team up with another US firm, Hershey, to submit a joint bid for Cadbury. However, on Friday Hershey decided not to attempt to purchase Cadbury, who are most famous for Dairy Milk chocolates.\n\nBoth companies had been given yesterday as their deadline to declare their intentions regarding their British rival. Kraft now seem likely to achieve their aim of buying up the confectioner, after four months of negotiations and an offer that was increased twice. Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 said Ferrero had backed out because of the amount of debt they would need to take on and a perceived requirement for job cuts.\n\nKraft are offering 500p cash per Cadbury share, plus Kraft stock. However, if some investors accept extra Kraft shares then up to 799p. The deal gives Cadbury a total value of 837p, down from the 850p orignally offered due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the United States dollar and the pound sterling. \"The final offer's value will change as the Kraft Foods share price and the USD/GBP exchange rate change,\" explained Kraft.\n\nJeremy Batstone-Carr, an analyst with Charles Stanley, said British stock investors were likely to not want Kraft shares. \"UK-based investors are unlikely to want to hold Kraft stock... We believe that as many as half these holders... will be looking for alternative investment destinations here in the UK.\" Shareholders have until February 2 to consider the offer. If they accept, Cadbury will cease to be an independant company, which it has been since it was founded in 1824.",

    "original_text": "-unreviewed\n\nEstonian and Finnish oil spill response vessels are working on cleaning up the oil spill caused by the sinking of the Runner 4. The Dominican-registered ship sank on March 6 near the Estonian coast in the Gulf of Finland.\n\nThis oil disaster may be even worse than the one of February, which was described by the BBC as the worst oil spill that Estonia has ever experienced. In the February spill, approximately 35 000 birds died. According to The Baltic Times, specialists say that this time up to 40 tons of oil might have leaked into the sea from the Runner 4. The ship was carrying, according to MTV3, over 100 tons of heavy fuel oil and 35 tons of light fuel oil.\n\nThe ship Runner 4 sank due to a collision with another ship, in a convoy following a Russian icebreaker. The crew managed to leave the ship before it sank.\n\nOn March 13, a week after the ship sank, the Estonian Border Guard sent its multipurpose vessel EVA-316 to the site to start the oil cleanup. Around the same time, the Finnish dedicated to the cleanup the oil spill response vessels Hylje, Halli and Seili. Also, the Finnish Frontier Guard patrol ship Merikarku was sent to the site to conduct underwater robot examinations of the sunken ship. According to the Finnish Environment Institute press briefing on this, Estonia does not have adequate equipment for oil spill response in icy conditions, so help was needed.\n\nThe reaction to the disaster is criticized by Jouni Pirttijärvi, an inspector at the Finnish Environment Institute (Ympäristökeskus). He says, according to Finland's national broadcasting company (YLE), that the countermeasures should have started a week ago, immediately after the disaster, instead of now. He said, \"It's difficult now to get the oil under control. It's spread all around, and ship traffic is spreading it further. We should have come here a week ago. Then the oil would have been closer to the disaster area the ship's sinking site. We weren't asked for help by the Estonians then, so now we decided to help without asking before it's too late.\" (Translation from the Finnish-language original). \n\nFinland will be paying the costs of the cleanup, as Estonia did not make an official request for help. The Estonian Border Guard's representative Helena Loorents says that Finland was not asked for help, as every day spent in the cleaning costs a lot of money. Estonia simply cannot afford this.\n\nAccording to Urmas Raudsepp, the director of Estonia's Institute of Marine Research, the oil spill's location was only found out on Thursday March 16. The Finnish ships had, however, arrived at the site on the day before.\n\nJouni Pirttijärvi also said that the conditions in the site are bad. The wind is over 17 meters per second (38 miles per hour) and it is raining. The oil spill is moving into waters too shallow for the three Finnish vessels, so they can no longer do their job. Hylje will be heading back to Finland on March 19 and the other two might follow within a few days. According to the Estonian paper Postimees, the oil spill is now a kilometer (0.6 mile) away from the Estonian capital of Tallinn.",

    "original_text": "Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is the lone holdout preventing a vote on synthetic marijuana legislation in the US Senate through a procedural block that is allowed under the rules. Until Paul lifts his block, the Senate will not be able to act on legislation that has already passed the US House of Representatives last December. Wikinews has investigated the block on the legislation.\n\nSynthetic marijuana can be sold over the counter in some places and it is commonly known by brand names, such as \"K2\" or \"Spice\". Other types of synthetic \"designer\" drugs, like \"bath salts\", belong to a class of substances that are in some cases legal, though they create a health hazard, because they are declared not meant for human consumption.\n\nAt issue in the legislation is the amount of chemical substances banned, the criminalization of substances, the authority of the federal versus the state government to makes those decisions, the extent to which the product is a threat or hazard to public health and safety, and the effect such a law would have on the research of these substances. All of these issues were debated in the House. Paul has made an issue of the long prison sentences for marijuana. His critics claim he is going too far by blocking legislation. Paul, a Republican who has libertarian leanings, has argued that the states should have the authority to ban drugs.\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 31 states have a ban on both synthetic cannabinoids and substituted cathinones while 39 states have a ban on synthetic cannabinoids. Rand's home state of Kentucky bans both. But legislation is not a perfect solution; in Cass County, Michigan, four teenagers between the ages of 13 and 14 had an emergency after using synthetic marijuana, but even though Michigan bans both, police are not sure that the substances are illegal. Chemists have to conduct tests on the products.\n\nAlthough Paul is framing the issue as a legal one, the medical community has turned its attention to this new phenomenon's impact on public health and safety. In an article that appeared in the March 2012 issue of Pediatriacs, medical researchers led by Dr. Joanna Cohen analyzed the cases of three teens who were hospitalized and treated as emergencies after an incident of synthetic marijuana use. One 16-year-old girl lost her motor skills and was unresponsive yet she had an exceptionally high heart rate and abnormal blood pressure. An 18-year-old boy was extremely sweaty, had a high heart rate and was agitated. And a 16-year-old boy had a speech dysfunction, as well as symptoms of agitation and confusion. The doctors who wrote the study say people are using this product because they believe it can give them a high similar to marijuana, however, the new drug can bring on both psychological symptoms, like psychosis and paranoia, and physical ones, such as convulsions.\n\nOne out of every nine high school students has reported use of synthetic marijuana, according to Monitoring the Future released in December 2011. The annual survey can be used to spot new trends in substance use among youth and the report included synthetic marijuana for the first time in 2011.\n\nPoison centers noticed a sharp increase in calls reporting incidents due to synthetic marijuana. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, in 2010 centers nationwide took 2,906 calls for synthetic marijuana cases, but by 2011, they took 6,959 calls. The problem is noticeable to local health officials, like in Syracuse, New York, which is Senator Chuck Schumer's state, where 120 cases were reported and one health professional called it \"a significant public health concern.\" New York has a ban on substituted cathinones but not synthetic canabanoids, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAlthough the US Drug Enforcement Agency placed five substances that fall under synthetic marijuana into Schedule I on March 1, 2011, its emergency powers only last one and a half years and its ban has not stopped other substances from being used instead. Schedule I is a running list of banned chemicals.\n\n4=Sen. Chuck Schumer\nThree of Paul’s Senate senior colleagues say Paul should drop his block. Senators Chuck Grassley, Chuck Schumer, and Amy Klobuchar are sponsoring bipartisan legislation that aims to ban synthetic marijuana as a serious health threat. The legislation is bipartisan as Grassley is a Republican , while both Schumer and Klobuchar are Democrats. Senator Schumer, in an editorial for the New York Daily News, advocated tackling synthetic marijuana at the national level rather than at the state. Schumer’s argument is that states have tried to ban the ingredients commonly found these products but the manufacturers have the flexibility to alter the ingredients to bypass the law. Schumer said the federal government needs a proactive rather than a reactive stance against drugs. \"All we need is one senator, Rand Paul of Kentucky, to release his block on this legislation,\" wrote Schumer. \"We’re urging him to do the right thing, and let us move forward with a vote.\"\n\nBefore the Senate took up the issue, similar legislation had already passed in the House. The House voted 317&amp;ndash;98 in favor of the Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2011 on December 8, 2011. Pennsylvania Congressperson Charles Dent sponsored the legislation that would add ingredients found in synthetic marijuana to Schedule I. Dent’s legislation included chemicals that are not even found in the United States at this time, but he argues that synthetic marijuana is too great of a public health threat to dismiss.\n\nStanding in opposition to the legislation, Virginia Congressperson Bobby Scott and several fellow Democrats argued Dent's legislation was bypassing a process for the banning of drugs that was already in place and established. Scott also argued some of the substances banned by the legislation were not even present in the United States but so far only in Europe. His colleagues argued researchers would lose the ability to conduct research freely on these substances and, as Scott noted, the legislation was seeking to ban substances but without any research to back it up.\n\nGrassley's legislation is named for David Rozga, an Iowan who committed suicide after using synthetic marijuana. In his speech, before the Senate, Grassley said Rozga's situation inspired him to put forward the legislation.\n\nFor some families, the issue has also become an emotional one, as they have lost a loved one. Karen Dobner, a mother from Aurora, Illinois, is blaming Senator Paul for any deaths that may still occur because he is holding up a legislative solution to a problem that she says killed her own son. When her son Max was in college, he tried a synthetic marijuana product and had a panic attack. Dobner believes the car crash that killed her son would not have happened had he not been experiencing the symptoms of the designer drug. Now Dobner keeps calling Paul's office begging him to stop his hold.\n\nSenator Paul's office was contacted by both phone and email about this report but it did not respond.",

The UNHCR says the refugees crossed the Oubangui River into neighboring Republic of Congo to find safety after their villages were burned.\n\nThe UN refugee agency reported that the mass exodus from the DRC's remote Equateur Province took place last week. It says ethnic clashes broke out between the Enyele and Munzaya tribes over farming and fishing rights in the village of Dongo.\n\nUNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic said that 60 people were killed, and the deadly fighting spread to surrounding villages, several of which were burned. He says 40 other people were seriously injured and some are being treated in hospital.\n\n\"The 16,000 DRC asylum seekers&amp;mdash;who are mainly Munzayas&amp;mdash;are staying in public buildings or with host communities across 11 villages alongside the Oubangui River,\" he said.\n\n\"A UNHCR team is now visiting them and our initial assessment is that they need proper shelter, food and household items such as blankets, kitchen sets and jerry cans. Since a thorough assessment is made, we will work together with the government to help them. Some are also in need of medical care, but an over-stretched mobile clinic run by a UNHCR partner cannot cope with all their needs at the moment,\" he added.\n\nThe first clashes between the Enyele and Munzaya occurred in March. More than 200 houses were burned in the village of Munzaya, and more than 1,200 residents fled to safety in the Republic of Congo.\n\nMahecic reported that the UNHCR is very concerned about the intensity of the violence and its spread to nearby villages. He says the villages have been virtually emptied of their inhabitants.\n\nHe says this latest violence, which is taking place in the west of the DRC is unrelated to fighting going on in the east, which has displaced 1.7 million people within the country.\n\nBefore the current influx, the UNHCR spokesman said the Republic of Congo already was hosting some 9,000 refugees from the DRC who had previously fled there to escape civil war in their country.\n\nAccording to Mahecic, when the DRC's civil war formally ended in 2003, large numbers of refugees returned home. But, he says this last group of 9,000 refugees does not want to return to the homes they fled in the DRC. They say they wish to settle permanently in the Republic of Congo.",

    "original_text": "In a new study released by the Florida Museum of Natural History on Monday, scientists report spiky skulls evolved at least 25 separate times in different kinds of frogs. The survey was reportedly to be published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nLead author Daniel Paluh, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Florida, said, \"Superficially, frogs may look similar, but when you look at their skulls, you see drastic differences ... Some of the weirdest skulls are found in frogs that eat birds and mammals, use their heads as a shield, or in a few rare cases, are venomous. Their skulls show how strange and diverse frogs can be.\"\n\nSome scientists had previously suggested smaller frogs would tend to develop spiky skulls, but that is not what this study reports. Here, researchers evaluated CT scans on 158 different species. They found frogs that had similar ecological niches &amp;mdash; meaning they either acquired food in the same way or defended themselves from predators in the same way &amp;mdash; tended to develop skulls with similar grooves, spikes, or specialized jaw joints regardless of whether they were ancestrally related to each other.\n\nAccording to the study, skulls with spikes, grooves or ridges &amp;mdash; called hyperossification &amp;mdash; often accompanied frogs eating very large prey relative to their own body size. The strong, spacious skulls would allow the frogs to have very big mouths with which to catch birds, rodents, reptiles and other frogs. Spikes sometimes coincided with venomous frogs. The researchers speculated the spikes make it dangerous for predators to hit the frog's head, as the spikes would break venom sacs under the frog's skin.\n\nOther bone formations included projections resembling fangs or lower teeth that different species of frogs use for catching prey and fighting. Very few frogs have true lower teeth.\n\nOne of the study's authors, herpetologist David Blackburn, told Discover Magazine the frequency of spiky skulls evolving in otherwise unrelated frogs suggested some deep pattern frogs fell into as circumstances arose: \"Somehow, these frogs are turning on some ancient developmental machinery in their DNA.\"\n\nSince 1973, when frogs skulls were last comprehensively surveyed, scientists have documented enough new species to double the number known to humans. Also, modern techniques exploit CT scans, of which Paluh and his team made liberal use. The research was part of the oVert project, funded by the National Science Foundation, meant to comprehensively CT-scan over 20,000 vertebrate specimens from United States museums.",

January 9 was set for a plea and case management hearing. The trial has been scheduled for April 2016, and is currently expected to last four weeks.\n\nPort, 40, attended the hearing from HMP Pentonville via videolink. He spent the ten-minute hearing looking down, and spoke only to confirm his identity. He wore a bright yellow and green prison-issued uniform designed to make him highly visible should he escape.\n\nPort faces four counts of murder and four counts of \"administering a poison with intent to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm\". He is alleged to have given overdoses of recreational drug GHB. He allegedly murdered the men at his home before dumping the bodies, after finding victims online using gay dating services.\n\nHe was charged on Sunday. On Monday he appeared before a Magistrates' Court which sent the case to today's hearing at the famed Old Bailey courthouse. Port has not applied for bail and remains in custody.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission concerning what police called \"potential vulnerabilities in our response to the four deaths.\" Police only linked the deaths a week ago on Wednesday, when they were passed to serious crime investigators.\n\nThree of the deaths occurred last year. Anthony Patrick Walgate, 23, was found dead on June 19, 2014 in Cooke Street. Port lives in Cooke Street. The other three alleged victims were found in the vicinity of St. Margaret's Church on North Street. Gabriel Kovari, 22, was discovered dead on August 28. Daniel Whitworth, 21, was found dead the following month on September 20. Fourth alleged victim Jack Taylor, 25, was found a year later on September 14.\n\nWhitworth and Kovari were known to each other, according to testimony at the inquest.\n\nPort was arrested following a police appeal to trace a man seen with Taylor shortly before his death. Police at the time released security footage of Taylor's movements, with an officer telling the press \"the man captured on CCTV may well be the last person to talk to Jack.\"",

    "original_text": "InternetThe Christian Science Monitor has announced plans to cease daily print publication. The newspaper employs 95 correspondents and 8 foreign bureaus and has won 7 Pulitzer Prizes, making it the most prominent newspaper to transition to online publication. It is due to celebrate its one hundredth anniversary later this month. The move has other major newspapers wondering whether this is the future of mainstream journalism.\n\n4=John Yemma, Christian Science Monitor editor\nEditor John Yemma stated \"It is the future for many papers, but because we are not-for-profit we are not exactly a model for for-profit publications.\" The Monitor receives its funding from the Christian Science Church, but is nonsectarian and does not proselytize, and the Church has no say in its editorial policy. The newspaper was founded in 1908 by Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy as a reaction against partisan journalism.\n\nThe new publication format will be a website updated daily, with subscribers receiving e-mail briefs of major stories and a 44 page weekly magazine. According to a report in The Independent, the weekly magazine \"will carry separate original content.\" The Monitor has made this announcement as a response to rising print publication costs and falling subscriptions. The actual changeover from a Monday through Friday publication five days a week to a single weekly magazine will occur in April 2009.\n\nYemma predicts that within the next five years, economic constraints will force most other newspapers to make similar changes. A small number of local newspapers made similar changes before the Monitor announced its plans. Two examples are The Capital Times and The Daily Telegram respectively of Madison, Wisconsin and Superior, Wisconsin.\n\nKen Doctor of Outsell Inc. assessed the economic situation for The New York Times. 92 percent of a typical newspaper's revenue comes from its print edition, so the cost of ceasing print publication exceeds the benefit in savings for most newspapers. The Monitor has an unusual funding profile, with significant resources coming from an endowment and donations. Most of its print revenue comes from subscriptions rather than from advertising. Nonetheless, industry trends led Brennon Slattery of PC World to predict this may be the first of a series of major print newspaper closings.",

There were earlier erroneous reports by the news media that martial law had been imposed. Mayor Ray Nagin fears that there may be \"thousands\" of fatalities in his city alone.\n\nMany hospital staff are struggling without power and supplies. As many as 2,500 patients from hospitals in Orleans Parish were to be evacuated, according to US Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt, but where they could be sent was still uncertain.\n\nLooters are roaming the city and have already ransacked the city's upscale shopping district on Canal Street. They have been seen on news reports carrying huge bags of stolen goods. Governor Kathleen Blanco announced plans to completely shut down New Orleans and move everybody left there out of the area. A rescue helicopter was shot at, temporarily halting all rescue operations.\n\nFormer mayor Marc Morial summed up his view by saying; \"We've lost our city, I fear it's potentially like Pompeii.\"\n\nTwo of the city's levees on Lake Ponchartrain failed; one with a football-field size breach.\nEmergency workers dropped sandbags from helicopters into the levee's breaches,\nbut the water kept coming.\n\n\"It appears that now the bowl is beginning to fill -- not rapidly but slowly,\"\nsaid Walter Maestri, an emergency operations manager. New floods swept through the center of New Orleans and water now covers 80 percent of the city with broken gas lines feeding raging fires. In some locations the water is now at a depth of 20 feet (six meters).\n\nThe famous French Quarter, initially less affected by flooding, finally also succumbed.\n\n\"Get out of town if you can.\" said Ed Freytag, a city worker at the temporary City Hall complex. \"We're damn close right now to that worst-case scenario,\" said Dave Cohen, a local radio host.\n\nFor those that were staying in the Superdome, officials have begun moving them to the long-vacant Astrodome in Houston, Texas.\n\n2005-08-31",

    "original_text": "White smoke appeared today at 5.50 p.m. local time over the Sistine Chapel in Rome - the first sign that a new Pope had been elected by the Conclave of Cardinals. A few minutes later, the bells of St. Peter's Basilica began ringing, confirming the election. Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger had been selected as the successor to Pope John Paul II as the 265th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, and will be known as Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nThe conclave of 115 cardinals started the process of electing a new Pope on Monday, April 18. However, it has taken two days for the required two thirds majority to be reached.\n\nThe new Pope appeared to the public within an hour of the first announcement. He appeared on the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and delivered a short address to the crowd in Italian. Tens of thousands of people were in St Peter's Square to observe the results of the election.\n\nThe election of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger follows the death of Pope John Paul II on April 2.\n\nPope Benedict XVI, born Joseph Ratzinger (born April 16, 1927) is pope of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1981 Cardinal Ratzinger was appointed prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (formerly known as the Office of the Holy Inquisition) by Pope John Paul II, made a Cardinal Bishop of the episcopal see of Velletri-Segni in 1993, and was elected Dean of the College of Cardinals in 2002, becoming titular bishop of Ostia. He was one of the most influential men in the Vatican and a close associate of the late Pope John Paul II. He presided over the funeral of John Paul II and also presided over the Conclave in 2005. During the sede vacante, he was the highest-ranking official in the Catholic Church.\n\nOn January 2, 2005, Time quoted unnamed Vatican sources as saying that Ratzinger was a front runner to succeed John Paul II should the Pope die or become too ill to continue as Pontiff. His see, Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia, has traditionally been an antechamber to the Papal seat.\n\nHowever it is important to note that Ratzinger's election to the Papal office was by no means certain. In conclaves men who are considered papabile often are not elected to office. At times men considered certain to win the election did not win. This is expressed in the saying, \"He who enters the conclave as Pope leaves as a Cardinal.\"\n\nRatzinger was considered to be Pope John Paul II's \"right hand man\" and also one of his closest friends and confidants, and during the Pope's final illness, he carried out many of the Pope's functions as leader of the Catholic Church.\n\nRatzinger has repeatedly stated he would like to retire to a Bavarian village and dedicate himself to writing books, but more recently, he told friends he was ready to \"accept any charge God placed on him.\" After the death of John Paul II on April 2, 2005 Ratzinger ceased functioning as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\n\nRatzinger speaks ten languages and has received seven honorary doctorate degrees. He is an accomplished pianist with a preference for Mozart.\n\nRatzinger was a member of the Hitler Youth during his teenage years, as was required by German law at the time. His father was very strongly anti-Nazi, and Ratzinger himself later deserted the German army.\n\nHe is the eighth German pope.\n\nIn April, 2005, he was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine.\n__NOTOC__",

    "original_text": "Prime Minister of Thailand, Thaksin Shinawatra, appears likely to be returned to office, making history as the first elected Thai PM to win a second term. If exit poll indications are borne out, his Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party will win in a landslide, to become the first single party majority in Thailand's relatively short history of parliamentary democracy.\n\nThe Thai Rak Thai (TRT) Party looks set to secure approximately 375 seats in the election, allowing them to form the first single-party elected government in Thailand's history. The main opposition party, Pak Prachatipat (Democratic Party), had hoped to secure 201 seats to prevent a TRT majority but conceded defeat long before the ballots were completely counted. The leader of the Democrats, Banyat Bantadtan, has announced he will resign.\n\n\"I would like to congratulate Thai Rak Thai for achieving its goal of being a single-party government,\" Banyat Bantadtan, leader of the Pak Prachatipat is quoted by the Independent as saying. \"I would like to encourage the two other opposition parties to join the Democrat party in monitoring the government for the benefit of the people.\"\n\nTRT has promised to eradicate poverty, by spending $60 billion on new infrastructure and pushing ahead with privatisation of state firms against fierce opposition from unions. Cheap loans and subsidised healthcare for Thailand’s poor rural areas sweetened the deal.\n\nAlready making history as the first elected PM to serve a full term, Thaksin is widely viewed as turning the recent Tsunami disaster into a political asset. When five- to eight-thousand Thais and foreign tourists were killed in the disaster, Mr. Thaksin responded by touring affected regions, refusing international aid loans, and promising farmers, fishermen, and the tourism industry support and compensation.\n\nThailand's economic growth rate during the past term in office had broken 6 per cent, second only to China, and rural income soared by 20 per cent.\n\nAnother big issue during the previous term was conflict between security forces and Muslim insurgents in the three southernmost provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. With around 10-30,000 troops on duty guarding polling stations, no overt violence arose during the vote, although there had been around 600 deaths in the past 13 months.\n\nThaksin himself has been dogged by conflict-of-interest and nepotism allegations, including in 2001 charges of concealing financial assets, which could have put him out of politics for five years. A controversial 2003 campaign against drug users was widely seen as amounting to simple assassination of drug dealers, with several hundreds or thousands of alleged extra-judicial killings condemned by the United Nations.\n\nAfter first entering Thai politics in 1994 as head of the anti-corruption Palang Dharma Party, the multi-billionaire head of telecom giant Shin Corporation had set about building TRT for the 2001 election. Forming a coalition from previous parties and factions, Thaksin was seated as PM with 248 seats of 438 to TRT.\n\nElection officials said there were 146 allegations of fraud which merited investigation, with opposition and independent observers saying that vote buying had started weeks ago. However, more than 70 percent of the 44.8 million eligible voters cast ballots in the country's population of 62 million.\n\n\"The election may be free, but I don't think fair,\" said Somsri Hananuntasuk of the Asian Network for Free Elections, citing reports that party workers were paying Bangkok slum dwellers 200 baht ($5.21) each for votes.\n\nOfficials were reportedly planning to confiscate mobile phones at polling booths and to arrest voters who snapped a picture of their completed ballot papers with a camera phone as proof to claim a payment, though whether any such incidents occurred is unknown.\n\nTwo Election Commission volunteers were killed in the south by gunmen during campaigning last month, but, according to General Kowit Wattana, Thailand’s police chief, “Ambushes and killings of candidates are down from four years ago.”",

    "original_text": "FranceA bus crash in France's Loire Valley has left seven of the Moroccan passengers dead. 22 of the 32 on board were injured, four critically, after the bus smashed into a concrete pillar on the A10 near Blois in the small hours of yesterday morning.\n\nThe bus had departed Tiznit in South Morocco on Wednesday and was headed to the Parisian suburb of Les Mureaux. It had been hired by Aziz, a French company that provides buses to tourists and small traders heading between France and Morocco.\n\nMedia images show the vehicle's front end stuck several feet up the pilar, with the roof trapped against the top of the bridge it supported by the pillar. The entire wreck is left leaning at about a forty degree angle back towards the road, and has left the road at a fairly steep angle directly into the pillar. The remains of a trailer it was towing can be seen still attached at the rear of the coach. Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau, who visited the scene shortly after the accident, said that “The incredible state of the bus showed that the impact was extremely violent.”\n\nThe pictures showed the bus was in the livery of travel company Labat.\n\nThe French Interior Ministry took the rare step of activating an emergency plan to ensure rapid response from large numbers of rescuers and resources. The scene was attended by four helicopters, 140 firefighters and 25 police officers, who had to free multiple victims from the wreck. The A10 was closed off.\n\nSix died immediately, and the seventh victim died shortly afterwards. All the deceased were adults, and included one of the two drivers, the other of whom was seriously injured. It is unclear which was driving at the time.\n\nInvestigators believe no other vehicles were involved, but the exact circumstances remain unclear. \"It looks like a loss of control. Is this linked to a mechanical problem, drowsiness or a totally different cause?\" Bussereau said at the scene. His ministry's accident investigation bureau will conduct a major investigation inquiry, and a separate investigation will be launched by local prosecuters.\n\nOne possible cause is that the driver fell asleep at the wheel. Investigators are also examining the bus to try to determine any sign of mechanical trouble. There was good weather in the region of the town of Suevres, where the accident occurred, and very little traffic was using the road at the time, thought to be around 2.50am (0050 GMT).\n\nMorocco's King Mohammed VI has announced he will personally pay for care of the injured and repatriation of those killed. He also asked the ambassador to France to pass on his condolences.",

He lured her to the basement where she was locked in a room, handcuffed and drugged. He is charged with incest, false imprisonment, murder, rape and the enslavement. The murder charge stems from allegations that Fritzl murdered a twin of one of the children. He then disposed of the body by placing the corpse into a heated oven, burning the body. Police say the child had died shortly after being born.\n\nPolice became suspicious when a 19-year-old daughter, Kerstin, was taken to hospital with a mysterious life-threatening illness, and the family's medical records were checked. Police say that Elisabeth F. appeared to be \"greatly disturbed\" psychologically, and only agreed to talk after the authorities assured her that she would not have to have contact with her father, and that her children would be cared for. When authorities arrived at his home, Fritzl told police what he had done. Of the surviving six children, there are three boys and three girls, between 5 and 20 years old.\n\nThe 27 page indictment says that Fritzl \"had equipped it the cellar with a double bed, a wash basin, a toilet, a TV, a video recorder, an oven and plastic crockery. In the cellar there was no daylight or fresh air. The only opportunity to wash was in a sink, there was no shower. There was also no hot water or heating.\" The indictment also stated that Fritzl's actions were \"premeditated.\"\n\nFritzl's lawyer, Rudolf Mayer, opened the trial saying that Fritzl was \"not a monster\" and that Fritzl \"was scared and regrets his actions\". As a precaution to prevent media infiltration and Fritzl's escape, authorities issued a no-fly warning above the courtroom.\n\nFritzl was arrested on April 27, 2008, in his home in Amstetten and if convicted, he would spend the rest of his life behind bars without the possibility of parole. The minimum sentence is said to be at least 15 years in prison. The trial is expected to last one week.",

It is believed up to four people who were in the vicinity of the dam before the breach may be missing.\n\nAn urgent flash flood warning was issued at 5:40 p.m. AEST (0740 UTC) following the breach. A wall of water was seen rushing downstream, leaving several people clinging to trees. The water was expected to travel quickly and cause flash flooding at river crossings and bridges along the river.\n\nThe mayor of the Central Highlands Regional Council, Peter McGuire, said the break was a \"disaster\". \"There are reports of people missing,\" he said. \"I've heard three and four people are missing but I don't know if that's right.\"\n\nHe added that the dam holds 22,900 megalitres of water and that a bladder on top of the dam's concrete wall had burst.\n\nEmergency services are at the scene, searching the riverbanks. A Queensland Police spokeswoman said a rescue helicopter was only on the way to the area to \"cover all bases\", but claimed to know nothing of the missing people, although rescue teams were being organised at the scene.",

    "original_text": "CanadaA University of Calgary research team developed a new method for extracting carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the air — a fundamental shift in carbon capture technology enabling capture of the most common greenhouse gas from so-called diffuse sources like aircraft, trucks and automobiles that represent half of the greenhouse gases emitted globally.\n\nProfessor David Keith, Director of University of Calgary's (UofC) Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy (ISEEE) and a team of researchers from UofC's Energy and Environmental Systems Group built and operated a prototype system this summer producing results that compared favourably with commercial carbon capture systems. Two 'provisional' patents have been filed on the technology but Keith warns there are still \"many pitfalls along the path to commercialization.\"\n\nUsing a process adapted from the pulp-and-paper industry that halves the cost of CO2 air capture in their custom-built tower, Professor Keith and his team captured the equivalent of about 20 tonnes per year of CO2 (approximately equal to the yearly output of one person in North America) directly from the air with less than 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity per tonne of carbon dioxide on a single square metre of scrubbing material.\n\n\"This means that if you used electricity from a coal-fired power plant, for every unit of electricity you used to operate the capture machine, you'd be capturing 10 times as much CO2 as the power plant emitted making that much electricity,\" explains Professor Keith.\n\nA report co-authored by Keith in the American Chemical Society's journal Environmental Science &amp; Technology explains \"nearly all current research on carbon capture and storage (CCS) focuses on capturing CO2 from large, stationary sources such as power plants. Such plans usually entail separating CO2 from flue gas, compressing it, and transporting it via pipeline to be stored underground.\"\nShould North American governments invest in bringing this technology to market?\nUsing CO2 air capture technology, \"a company could, in principle, contract with an oil sands plant near Fort McMurray to remove CO2 from the air and could build its air capture plant wherever it's cheapest — China, for example — and the same amount of CO2 would be removed,\" says Professor Keith in a UofC press release.\n\n\"While it's important to get started doing things we know how to do, like wind power, nuclear power, and 'regular' carbon capture and storage,\" Professor Keith continues, \"it's also vital to start thinking about radical new ideas and approaches to solving this problem.\"\n\nISEEE's Executive Director David Layzell points out that \"energy-efficient and cost-effective air capture could play a valuable role in complementing other approaches for reducing emissions from the transportation sector, such as biofuels or electric vehicles.\"",

Access to this group of compromised machines will then be available on a black market, at prices as low as five cents per machine.\n\n*Win32.Glieder.AK: The first of the three, this Trojan horse attempts to de-activate an extensive list of security/antivirus related processes and services running on the target computer. It also attempts to lower security settings in order to facilitate easier access for subsequent Trojan horses.\n\n*Fantibag: This second Trojan horse creates filters on the target machine in order to prevent access to a large number of antivirus companies' Web sites. Thus, not only is the target computer now well and truly compromised, but an average Windows user will be completely unable to remove these violations of their system.\n\n*Mitgleider: Once the first two Trojan horses have largely eliminated any possibility that the target will be able to defend itself, this one finishes the job. It opens port 38884 and configures it to act as a SOCKS 4 proxy, but the compromised system can now also be commanded to do the following:-\n**Changing the backdoor port number\n**Updating the trojan\n**Downloading and execute files\n**Uninstalling the trojan\n**Initiating an SMTP server on TCP port 25, which can be used to relay spam.\n**Executing files on the infected computer\n**Downloading and executing files via an URL\n\nIt should be noted that these Trojan horses only affect the Microsoft Windows family of operating systems. No other operating systems (such as Linux and Apple's OS X) are vulnerable. In order to prevent infection, Windows users are advised to ensure that they have the latest operating system patches from Microsoft, that their chosen antivirus software is up to date, and that they are using firewall software where appropriate.",

According to a study produced\nby a team of researchers supported by the International Ocean Drilling\nProgram, this is the first time that microbes have been found in abundance at such depths.\n\nScientists have long speculated about how much of the bacterial content of\nthe sediments is biologically active. Techniques used to stain the bacteria and\nidentify them could not previously discriminate between live and dead\ncells. For this study a new technique that could distinguish between alive\nand dead cells was used.\n\nThe results were surprising. The sediments, some of which had been\ncollected from up to 800 metres from beneath the sea floor and\nare said to be up to 16 million years old, contained between 10-30% living\nbacteria. Scientists estimate that between 60-70% of all bacteria are\nliving deep beneath the surface, far from any sunlight.\n\n\"We didn't have clear evidence that bacteria there were alive until now,\"\nsaid ecologist and team member Lev Neretin of the Max Planck Institute for Marine Biology\nin Bremen, Germany. According to calculations,\nthe populations of bacteria multiply at the same rate as their surface\ncousins and contribute significantly to the balance of greenhouse gases,\nconsuming and producing CO2. They also contribute methane via a metabolic\nprocess that does not require oxygen.\n\n\"Because they play such a major role in the biochemical processes in the\nsubsurface, clearly they are driving lots of reactions that produce the\nchemical steady state on Earth,\" said Dr John Parkes, one of the original\nco-authors of the paper which appeared in Nature magazine, \"possibly we\nmight not have oil and gas formations without them.\"\n\nHow could these bacteria get so deep beneath the ocean floor? \"The only\nreasonable way is for them to be buried there,\" says Bo Thamdrup, a\nmicrobiologist from the University of Southern Denmark, Odense. The\nextremes of temperature and pressures tolerated by these bacteria add\nweight to the assertion that microbes may flourish in the extreme\nconditions of other planets.\n\n\"It is well known that bacteria living in deep oceans have special\nadaptations to help them survive,\" says Thamdrup. \"I'm sure these bacteria\nhave special adaptations too.\" A full genetic analysis may soon reveal\nthem.",

Mr Keelty has said that the details of the allegations against the men should be kept secret.\n\n\"An application will be made by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution this afternoon to suppress the details of the allegations,\" he said.\n\nKeelty justified the action by arguing that \"we give these people a fair opportunity to prepare their defence before the court rather than run the trial in the media.\"\n\nIn Victoria, warrants were executed in Dallas, Hoppers Crossing, Fawkner, Preston, Haberfield, Coburg, Yarraville, Meadow Heights, Hadfield and Mount Druit, resulting in 9 arrests.\n\nVictorian Police Commissioner Christine Nixon also believes that the raids prevented a terrorist attack, however she stated that the police did not know what form the attack would take, saying \"we weren't exactly sure when nor, more importantly, what they planned to damage or do harm to.\" Commissioner Nixon said that they had sufficient evidence to proceed.\n\nNixon said that the raids were the result of a long-term operation. When queried, she confirmed that the anti-terror legislation rushed through Parliament last week was related to today's raids. \"Some of that is related to that amendment that occurred,\" she said. The changes became law just two days ago.\n\nThose arrested will be charged with \"a range of offences\", however the exact nature of the charges is yet to be announced. It is not yet clear to what extent the emergency legislative changes rushed through parliament last week are a legal basis for the arrests.\n\nOne of those arrested in Melbourne was Abu Bakr, also known as Abdul Nacer Benbrika. He is a dual Algerian and Australian citizen, and was criticised last August when he told ABC Radio that he supported al-Quaeda. At the time he denied being involved in any terrorist activity.\n\nIn an interview on the ABC Radio \"National Breakfast\" program, Rob Stary, a criminal defence lawyer who will be representing those arrested in the Melbourne raids said that, as far as he is aware, the charges all relate to being a member of a proscribed organisation, and none of the Melbourne suspsects had been charged in relation to any planning or preparation offences. At the time of the interview he was not aware which proscribed organisation the charges relate to.\n\nSeven men have appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court, on charges of intentionally being a member of a terrorist organisation and knowing the organisation was a terrorist organisation. The court has heard that Abu Bakr is the \"spiritual leader\" of the group and the prosecutor alleged that the organisation is directed by Abu Bakr. Speaking of the Melbourne arrests, Prosecutor Richard Maidment QC alleged that the group constituted a \"terrorist organisation\". Making reference to the Sydney arrests he said that the Sydney suspects had \"gathering chemicals of a kind that were used in the London Underground bombings,\" and planned to kill \"innocent men and women in Australia.\"",

Hirant Dink was gunned down in front of his office on February 19 in Istanbul by Ogün Samast, a 17 year old ultra-nationalist Turk.\n\nAccording to the Turkish daily newspaper Radikal, Bahattin Hayal told to the public prosecutor that following the killing of Hrant Dink and subsequent arrest of Hayal's son Yasin, as the mastermind behind the killing, he was taken to the Trabzon Security Services. Here he was told by a Turkish police chief that \" His son (Yasin Hayal) would now live better. We would write our report accordingly. The flag could be taken from the ground by people like Yasin. He would not receive an heavy punishment with our report. God permits he would be given a light sentence.\"\n\nOn the hand other, Yasin Hayal forwarded five petitions to the public prosecutors' Selim Berna Altay and Fikret Seçen, in February and March of this year and informed them that he was encouraged to kill Hrant Dink and given directions by Erhan Tuncel, who was a police informant. Hayal also reported that an officer-in-charge who was working at the Trabzon Security Services visited Hayal and Tuncel prior to the killing and told them that \"the Turkish flag had fallen to the ground and people like Erhan and Yasin would raise the flag\". In his statement to the Prosecutors, Tuncel reported the same incident and also stated that he had informed the authorities about the assassination plan but the authorities failed to take an action to prevent the killing of Hrant Dink.\n\nThe Turkish Public Prosecutors believe that Erhan Tuncel planned the killing of Hrant Dink together with Yasin Hayal and knowingly misled the authorities.\n\nMilliyet, a Turkish daily newspaper reported that Erhan Tuncel in his statement to the Public prosecutors stated that he had informed the authorities 16-17 times prior to the killing. Moreover, Milliyet reported a 48 page report about Erhan Tuncel, prepared by the Security services gone missing.",

Ukraine has already before urged Russia to withdraw its troops from Georgia's territory. Last weekend Ukraine threatened to refuse the Russian vessels reentry to the Sevastopol naval base if they became involved in the conflict in Georgia.\n\nThe Russian fleet is based in Sevastopol on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula under an agreement signed between Russia and Ukraine. Under the terms of the decree, the Russian navy is compelled to obtain Ukrainian permission 72 hours in advance of the departure of any of its warships or aircraft. Ukraine's foreign ministry would be empowered to demand a vessel leave Ukrainian territory if the Russians did not comply.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov described the Ukrainian move as reflecting \"an obsessive desire to please NATO and join it.\" Russian deputy chief of General Staff, Anatoly Nogovitsyn, dismissed the decree as \"nonsense\" and said that the order would make Russia's Black Sea Fleet subordinate to the Ukrainian government. According to Russian RIA Novosti news agency, Yushchenko sent a proposal to Russia on Friday to draft a bilateral agreement on the Russian Black Sea fleet deployed in Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian fleet blocked several Ukrainian vessels in the Georgian port of Poti but within a couple of days they were released. Georgian Chief of Staff Serhiy Kirichenko said on Thursday that the presidential decree would be carried out, no matter what.\n\n\"Putin's next target will be Ukraine\" said Richard Holbrooke, a former United States Ambassador to the United Nations in a CNN interview.",

In its winter forecast, the European Commission stated the economy of the Eurozone, which consists of 17 countries, is projected to shrink by 0.3% this year. This comes after a 0.6% contraction last year and marks a reversal from the committee's previous prediction of 0.1% growth in 2013.\n\nUnemployment in the Eurozone is set to reach 12.2% in 2013, an increase from the 2012 level of 11.4%. Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, said that \"decisive policy action undertaken recently is paving the way for a return to recovery\". He went on to say: \"We must stay the course of reform and avoid any loss of momentum, which could undermine the turnaround in confidence that is underway, delaying the needed upswing in growth and job creation.\"\n\nThe International Monetary Fund stated in January they expected the group of countries to experience a \"mild recession\" throughout 2013. The extended recession will see millions of people lose their jobs, the European Commision said, with the level of people unemployed across the region expected to continue to rise. The rise in unemployment could reach over 20 million across the Eurozone as the recession persists.",

She said \"What's been put forward here is who is best able to judge the quality, safety and efficacy of this particular drug and who is best able to judge whether it should be used in Australia\".\n\nMs Nash believes that the TGA should be responsible for allowing or denying the use of drugs in Australia, not the health minister.\n\nLyn Elisson, leader of the Democrats said that only around 2,000 of the submissions would be considered as the remainder do not meet the senate's terms of reference. She also said \"This bill is not about the morality or legality of abortion.\n\n\"It's really about whether the Minister for Health should have the power of veto over an alternative to legal surgical abortion.\"\n\nNational's senator Barnaby Joyce argues that all opinions should be taken into account and that the enquiry should be conducted for at least a week.\n\nPeter Slipper, MP for the Liberal party claims that the proposed legislation can not be separated from the RU486 issue. He told ABC radio \"I believe it would be a negation of our responsibility if we were to flick the decision to an unelected body, an unaccountable body, such as the TGA.\"\n\nIt is believed that only 100 submissions are from those supporting the use of RU486.\n\nThe inquiry has received international attention with submissions from the US, New Zealand and Austria.\nThis pill has been available for use in France since 1988, in Switzerland since 1999.",

Serapio who also faced similar charges of plunder and perjury were proclaimed not guilty.\n\nA special division of the anti-graft court was created to specifically hear the case of Estrada and found beyond reasonable doubt that the former President was guilty of plunder.\n\nThe court's decision stated that Estrada received money from illegal gambling and collected commissions from the sale of publicly listed Belle Corp. shares.\n\nThe court stated that it found not enough evidence to tie Estrada to charges of misappropriating tobacco excise taxes and amassing wealth deposited in the so-called \"Jose Velarde\" account.\n\nThe 262-page decision stated that, \"The predicate acts alleged in the two cases were linked by the fact that they were plainly geared towards a common goal which was the accumulation of ill-gotten wealth ... and that they shared a pattern or a common method of commission which was the abuse or misuse of the high authority or power of the presidency.\"\n\nAs a result of the court's decision, the state will forfeit Mr. Estrada’s accounts that includes P545.29 million (US$11.5 million) credited to the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation and the P189-million (US$ 4.10 million) Velarde account, including the so-called Boracay Mansion in New Manila, Quezon City.\n\nEstrada, who was also a popular movie actor said in an interview after the verdict that the three person panel of judges of the anti-graft court were \"pressured\" to ensure the legitimacy of the incumbent administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\n\nMrs. Arroyo assumed the office of the President on January 20, 2001 when a peaceful uprising forced Mr. Estrada to step down from office.\n\nThe 70-year-old former President declared this Sunday that his lawyers will appeal should the court find him guilty and he is prepared to face incarceration. Estrada added that he will not ask for any form of pardon from incumbent President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who assumed office when Estrada was ousted.\n\nMr. Estrada proclaimed before members of media after the verdict was read saying, \"I submitted myself to the rule of law when I allowed the impeachment proceedings against me to take its course. I did not resort to influence, the trial nor to any acts that may constitute obstruction of justice, whitewash or cover-ups.\"\n\nThe former president re-emphasized his position that he will never ask for any form of pardon from Mrs. Arroyo's administration and he was prepared to serve his sentence at the National Penitentiary among the common people with no special privileges.\n\nEstrada, has been on detention by virtue of a \"house arrest\" at his rest house at Tanay in Rizal Province, east of the capital Manila.\n\n\"I am at peace with myself notwithstanding the guilty verdict because you, my beloved countrymen, have overwhelmingly acquitted me,\" Estrada added.\n\nThe Philippine government placed the entire military and police on its highest level of alert, more than a week ahead in preparation for the Estrada verdict.\n\nTraffic around the anti-graft court was re-routed and classes from among nearby schools were also suspended to pre-empt any possible security problems resulting from pro-Estrada supporters.\n\nOn May 1, 2001, thousands of Estrada supporters amassed before Malacañan Palace to protest the incarceration of the former President and attempted to unseat Mrs. Arroyo to restore Estrada.\n\nThe office of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo appealed before the public to \"let the rule of law prevail.\"\n\nMrs. Arroyo stated during a speech before a mix group of delegates at the Presidential palace calling for \"peace and reconciliation\" after the verdict has been rendered.\n\nThe president has also called for an end on \"political drama,\" to allow the country's economy progress to move forward with no fear from political instability.",

Palm Beach County in Florida issued an evacuation order to some residents, effective 1 p.m. on Sunday, after the NHC placed Palm Beach County under a tropical storm warning.\n\nA Category 5 hurricane is a form of tropical cyclone. On the Saffir–Simpson scale used by the NHC for classifying tropical cyclones, at Category 5, \"catastrophic damage will occur\". The wind speed cut-off for Category 5 hurricanes is 157 miles per hour (mph); the NHC advisory indicated Dorian's maximum sustained winds were near 180 mph (285 kph).",

Police report at least 20 people being injured. The gunman was reportedly killed at the scene by police. Students told reporters that they heard several shots in the building at about 12:45 local time. One student told a local radio station that she saw two people who had been shot, including one who was hit at the neck. The student said a friend told her four people had been shot.\n\nHundreds of students fled the building, and the area has been cordoned off. Nearby Plaza Alexis Nihon and Westmount Square were evacuated and the Green line of the Montreal Metro was shut down between Lionel-Groulx and Peel. Police officers wearing bullet-proof vests are keeping people away from the college. \"They're telling me, 'Go the other way, lady, you're in the line of fire,'\" said CBC News reporter Nancy Wood, who reported from the scene.\n\nLocal media have reported police hotlines have been established for loved ones to gain more information: +1-(514)-280-2880, +1-(514)-280-2805, and +1-(514)-280-2806. The Montreal General Hospital has also set up a hotline at +1-(514)-843-2839.\n\nPolice have reported that the situation has been neutralized as of 20:06, September 13, 2006 (UTC). Police have been told to stand down and are no longer looking for new victims or shooters.\n\nDawson College is a CEGEP that hosts about 10,000 students.\n\nEarlier reports suggested that there were between two and six gunmen, however, reports are generally that there were two, maybe three. Police have only confirmed that there was one gunman, Kimveer Gill, who was shot dead \"after police intervention,\". They will not say anything about additional shooters. A close witness to Gill's last moments reported being used as a shield during the shootout with police officers, who allegedly hit Gill in the arm. The shooter would then have turned his weapon on himself.\n\nThe gunman was Kimveer Gill, a 25 year old Laval man. He was carrying three guns: a Beretta Cx4 Storm carbine, a Glock 9mm handgun, and a Norinco HP9-1 sawed-off shotgun.\n\nUp to 20 shots were fired over a period of 30 minutes.\n\nPolice have indicated 20 people have been injured in the incident. CBC reports that 16 people are injured, and 2 have been killed, including the gunman. Montreal General Hospital officials have stated that 11 people have been admitted with gunshot wounds, 8 of them in critical condition. A spokeswoman also stated that 3 others were taken to Jean Talon Hospital and two others were taken to the Jewish General Hospital. The spokeswoman went on to report that most of the injuries are to the abdomen and limbs, and one victim with an injury to the head.",

The attackers have inserted code to install malware onto visitors' computers. The code exploits a newly-discovered weakness in Adobe Flash Player, a very common web-browser plugin. The attacks prompted an investigation by the Taiwanese information security industry into the source of these attacks.\n\nAn SQL injection is a common method employed by malicious users to attack and deface websites, arising from website mistakes in checking user input. Attackers take advantage of these weaknesses to inject information of their choosing into the website. For example, in June of 2007, Microsoft UK found its webpage changed to a picture of the Saudi Arabia flag, an attack which was carried out using an SQL injection.\n\nAccording to SecurityFocus, this most recent series of attacks stems from a vulnerability in versions 9.0.115.0 and 9.0.124.0 of Flash Player. It allows attackers to load any code they wish onto a computer running these versions of Flash.\n\nAs the vulnerability in Flash is newly discovered, Adobe has not yet released a newer version which fixes the problem. For the time being, computer security experts recommend that internet users with one of the unprotected versions of Flash disable the plug-in on Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer to prevent malicious users from gaining control over their computers.\n\nThe most recent version of the Flash Player, version 9.0.124.0, does not appear to be vulnerable to this exploit.",

    "original_text": "Steve Kubby who was facing extradition from Canada, returned to California, was arrested, and is now in custody in Placer County, California Jail, pending a hearing today. He is a medical cannabis patient who relies on the drug to regulate the symptoms of malignant phenochromocytoma, a cancer of the adrenal gland which can cause the level of adrenaline in his system to fluctuate out of control. If left unregulated, this can result in sudden, fatal heart attack, stroke, pneumonia, and a variety of other conditions.\n\nKubby was arrested on arrival at San Francisco International Airport Thursday night on behalf of the Placer County Sheriff's Department, having exhausted his extradition appeals in Canada. He was taken to San Mateo County Jail, pending transport to Placer County Jail. While at San Mateo County Jail, he was reportedly denied access to medication and sufficient bedding. On arrival at Placer County Jail, his blood pressure was dangerously high, and so was given Marinol, a THC synthetic.\n\nCommunication with Kubby is highly restricted. According to his wife, Michele, Kubby has been placed in solitary confinement, denied access several times to sufficient bedding to keep him warm, and denied access to the cannabis which, according to several experts on his universally fatal condition, has been solely responsible for keeping him alive for decades. The Marinol he is being given partially mitigates his symptoms, but does not completely control them. He now grows dangerously ill.\n\nIn particular, he relates how he was ordered by prison medical staff to take beta-blockers for his blood-pressure. Due to the episodic nature of the adrenaline spikes causing the high blood-pressure, according to all of his doctors, the beta-blockers would likely kill him once the spikes dropped. In an interview by phone with journalist Pat McCartney over the weekend, Kubby reported that, for refusing the beta-blockers, he was coerced into signing a waiver absolving the prison of liability, and has since been refused all care, including even Tylenol for pain management.\n\nActivists concerned with medical marijuana, human rights and prison reform will hold a rally at noon today in front of the Placer County Superior Courthouse, where Steve Kubby is scheduled to be arraigned on violation of probation charges.\n\nKubby was a co-author of California's Compassionate Use Act of 1996, also known as Proposition 215. He fled to Canada in 2001 to escape the possibility of incarceration for an extended period without access to cannabis, a possibility which, in both his and expert medical opinion, would certainly prove fatal.",

    "original_text": "Modern polar bears are genetically related to an extinct species of Irish brown bear, according to a study published Thursday in Current Biology. The two share a distinct genetic marker not present in other brown bears, strongly suggesting that all modern polar bears are descended from the same extinct species.\n\nThe study found evidence of polar bear hybridization with a now-extinct population of brown bears that lived in Ireland and Britain during the last ice age. Brown bears are no longer found on the British Isles, and it had been thought that polar bears interbred more recently with brown bears living around Alaska. However, the samples used in the analysis came from the past 120,000 years and show that interbreeding of the two species occurred a great deal earlier. Climate change is thought to have presented opportunities for the two species to mate now and then in the past 100,000 years.\n\nThe evidence comes from a DNA analysis of fossil bones collected from the teeth and bones of seventeen bears from eight Irish caves. Ten Irish brown bears from between 10,000 and 38,000 years ago carried a distinct sequence of mitochondrial DNA, originating from a specific female brown bear, and this DNA sequence has been passed down the female polar bear line and is found in all polar bears today. It is not found in modern bears from Europe.\n\nFossils from the last species of ancient brown bears in Ireland, living from 3,000 to 5,000 years ago, have a different genetic fingerprint, matching neither that of polar bears nor of modern brown bears.\nsource=Authors, Ancient Hybridization and an Irish Origin for the Modern Polar Bear Matriline\nA member of the international team conducting the study, Dr Ceiridwen Edwards from Oxford University, said: \"Hybridisation between ancient Irish brown bears and polar bears has led to the complete replacement of the original polar bear mitochondria. This maternal lineage is now present in all modern polar bears.\"\n\nThe authors of the paper conclude that their evidence shows that matrilineal history of brown and polar bears suggest that \"a likely genetic exchange with extinct Irish brown bears forms the origin of the modern polar bear matriline.\" They suggest that hybridization may be more common than previously recognized and may be a way species deal with loss of their habitats when the environment is changing.",

The injunction was first filed due to Sky broadcasting too much coverage of the Rugby World Cup, which TV3, owned by MediaWorks, has the exclusive television rights to in New Zealand.\n\nA temporary injunction was issued on September 12 and a full hearing took place that Friday. However, the Judge, Justice Helen Winkelmann, reserved her decision and released it this morning.\n\nThe Auckland High Court injunction will prohibit footage being used on Sky programmes The Cup, and Reunion. Sky-owned free-to-air channel, Prime Television, is also prohibited from using footage for The Crowd Goes Wild. These shows were described as being in a magazine style, and not in a news and current affairs format.\n\nTV3 does have an agreement with Sky, as well as with TVNZ (Television New Zealand), which allows use of it's footage for \"hard news programmes\", but not on niche or magazine styles shows.\n\nOn the news format shows, only three screenings spaced three hours apart each day will be allowed. John Fellet, chief executive of Sky, said that broadcasting will continue as normal for it's news shows, such as Sport 365. Sky Sport 1, Sky Sport 2, Sky Sport 3, and SKY Sports Highlights will be counted as one channel for the total allowable screening time.\n\nRick Friesen, chief operating officer of MediaWorks, said, \"The judge has clearly understood all the issues in this case and upheld TV3's right to protect its interests, expanding significantly upon the temporary order issued last week.\"\n\nSky have stated that they will now crack down on TV3's use of their footage. Sky has the rights to most sports, including the Super 14, Tri-Nations, and more. Fellet said, \"It looks like in the longer term we have won, one way of the other. ...We will now reciprocate by closely scrutinising MediaWorks' use of Sky footage.\"",

The suspect protested his innocence. Authorities \"slightly\" raised the country's terrorist alert level after the explosion. The explosion caused only minor damage to a hotel bathroom, and no-one was killed or suffered serious injuries in the explosion. Only the suspect suffered minor injuries.\n\nThe suspect was arrested in a park after being seen running from the hotel. A remote-controlled robot was used to detach a pack from his waist, since authorities were concerned that it could contain explosives. The suspect's identity has not been fully established and he is refusing to cooperate with authorities, according to police. The man reportedly does not remember his name or his age, but speaks fluent English. The man denies initial charges of intending to harm others by an explosion and firearms possession. If he is found guilty, he could face life imprisonment. Jakob Scharf, head of the Danish Security and Intelligence Service (PET) said that \"there are circumstances that point in the direction of a failed terror attack,\" adding that authorities \"cannot exclude that there could be other suspects at large.\" The agency said that \"due to this, we have taken a number of measures to protect potential terror targets and to sharpen the police's attention regarding suspect situations.\"\n\nPrime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen described the incident as \"serious\", adding that his government was closely monitoring developments. A retired head of the PET, Hans Joergen Bonnichsen, has said that there is a great deal of \"uncertainty\" surrounding the case. \"The authorities prefer to be better safe than sorry. It can be anything between terror and a mentally unstable man.\"\n\nThe \"slightly raised\" risk of a terror attack means that authorities will be more alert throughout the country. Police are attempting to determine what kind of explosives caused the explosion. Police have said they have so far found no other explosives in the hotel, although a gun was found. The hotel remains closed as police continue their investigation.",

Seeing the picture of the piano, the medical staff at the Medway Maritime Hospital where he was admitted showed him the piano in the hospital chapel. To their amazement he sat at the instrument and played classical and pop music for several hours.\n\nMany press reports have emphasized the piano playing, and the man has been labelled \"The Piano Man\" by many news services, although the hospital staff has been calling him \"Mr. X.\"\n\nHowever, the chaplain of the hospital, the Reverend Steve Spencer, said the man \"is not the virtuoso that he has been portrayed in the press. He knows a small number of tunes and plays them over and over. I recognized some John Lennon and a snippet from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake.\"\n\nThe man also pointed to a flag of Sweden when shown an atlas, initially leading the hospital staff to believe he was from Sweden.

However, this lead turned up cold on May 18 when Masson's sister, Julie Villa Massone said, \"I saw my brother yesterday in Nice.\" Also, AFP found him living in Nice near the train station.\n\nA Wikinews contributor believes that the person referenced is an acquaintance of his named Geoffrey Betts. Betts is an actor who is a citizen of the U.K. Betts has lived much of his life in the Dallas, Texas area and has spent some time recently in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nA visual comparison of the person in the various news articles can be compared to Geoff's website (listed in External links below).

    "original_text": "Aviation\n\nAuthorities are investigating what's left of debris believed to belong to a plane, that washed ashore several small islands in the Maldives. The investigation began as a result of photos of the debris being uploaded to the social networking website Facebook. Some of the debris is reported to have washed ashore as early as May 31 and was found on a beach owned by the Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru resort, located in Kaafu Atoll. In the past few days, several other pieces of debris were recovered on at least three other islands. Authorities are trying to determine if it may be part of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370). Last week, a piece of a wing known as a flaperon, reported to be from MH370, was found washed ashore on Réunion Island.\n\nPictures taken of the objects recovered in the Maldives on, reportedly, May 31, were posted to Facebook by an employee of the resort. That prompted authorities to launch an investigation into the debris, but before it could be examined, it had already been sent away for disposal. The photographs show a large white object, possibly two, stained with algae and appear to be made of a fiberglass and honeycomb material. The objects appear to be several feet in length and width and in one photo where the paint is severely peeled, red letters \"IC\" can be seen. Those pieces, along with others, were taken away and disposed of as trash. When authorities discovered the photographs, they returned to the site, but only found a small, five to seven inch (about 13&amp;ndash;18&amp;nbsp;cm) piece of debris they say doesn't appear to be part of a plane.\n\nAccording to the resort's manager Mr. Naseem, the bigger pieces of debris and other waste were taken away and disposed of in the usual way. He added other forms of debris and trash with no value, such as buoys and suspected military waste, wash up on the islands all the time, especially during monsoon season. Local residents and resort workers regularly collect trash which is sent to the garbage island Thilafushi where it's sorted, exported for recycling, or burned. Reports say at the time the debris was collected, no one suspected it could be from MH370.\n\n\"Although some of it was taken to Thilafushi, there is still a five or a seven inch piece on the resort. It was left because it is small. The management has decided to hand it over to the Police\", said an unnamed official to SunOnline, who said authorities don't know if any of the debris taken away has been destroyed. The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of the Maldives Police Service and experts from the Maldives Civil Aviation Authority are heading the investigation.\n\nYesterday, reports stated several more pieces of debris, one piece measuring some eight feet by two feet (about 2.4 by 0.6&amp;nbsp;m), were found on Baa Atoll, Fehendhoo and Fulhahdhoo and washed ashore sometime in the past few days. One piece appears to have a serial number on the side, possibly reading '021411270507.' Initially residents who found the debris took it home. \"A resident had found the debris and taken it home. Nobody had thought twice about it then. When he heard about the discovery in Vabbinfaru resort we immediately called the Police,\" said Mohamed Ibrahim, a councilman for Fehendhoo Island, to Haveeru Daily.\n\nMH370, while flying from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, China, vanished without a trace on March 8, 2014. All 239 passengers and crew are believed to be dead. On the day the plane went missing, residents on the small Maldive island of Kudahuvadhoo claimed to have seen a very \"low flying jumbo jet\" crash into the Indian Ocean. Some also noted the colors appeared to resemble that of a Malaysia Airlines plane. \"I’ve never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly\", one resident was quoted as saying to the newspaper Haveeru Daily. Some claim the plane appeared to be headed in the direction of Diego Garcia.\n\nAccording to The Huffington Post, Haveeru reported the witnesses were interviewed by authorities who deemed their statements to be truthful, but Maldive military officials along with Malaysian officials say no such aircraft was in Maldive airspace at the time MH370 went missing. \"Based on the monitoring up to date, no indication of Flight MH370 has been observed on any military radars in the country Maldives. Furthermore, the data of radars at Maldives airports have also been analysed and shows no indication of the said flight\", said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein.",

    "original_text": "Australian news\n\nThe Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard, has announced new measures to alleviate the impact of rising global oil prices on Australians. They include grants of up to $2,000 to switch to LPG, and $17.2 million over three years to improve E10 blend ethanol fuel infrastructure.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament House, the Prime Minister outlined the cause of higher petrol and diesel prices as a consequence of increasing global demand for oil occurring at a time when additional supply is tight. He singled out the re-emergence of China as a major factor in the increase in demand, and underinvestment as the main reason that supply cannot be increased rapidly.\n\nThe Prime Minister once again said he would not lower fuel excises, saying that any benefit that might bring would be quickly devoured by further rises in global oil prices, and would leave a large hole in the Federal budget.\n\nHe announced that the $1,000 grant to purchases of new vehicles equipped to run on LPG would be brought forward from 2011 to be effective immediately. In addition, he announced that conversions of private vehicles to LPG would be eligible for a $2,000 grant, also effective immediately.\n\nLPG is much cheaper than petrol in Australia, partly due to concessional tax treatment. The Prime Minister said that a six cylinder vehicle that travels 15,000 kilometres in a year would save $27 per week at current prices if converted from petrol to LPG. With the $2,000 grant, the conversion would pay for itself in four months.\n\nThe cost of the eight-year program to convert vehicles from petrol to LPG, including lost excise revenue, is estimated to be $1.3 billion.\n\nOn the ethanol front, the Prime Minister announced a further $17.2 million dollars over three years to help petrol retailers install or convert pumps for E10 blends. Eligible petrol stations will receive up to $10,000 towards the cost of conversion or installation, once complete, and an additional $10,000 when sales targets are met.\n\nThe Prime Minister also made mention of remote communities that rely on diesel for their electricity supply. He said that the existing Renewable Remote Power Generation Programme has helped remote communities reduce their reliance on diesel, through the use of renewable energy services like wind turbines. He announced that the Government will extend this programme with an additional $123.5 million over four years, and will now include energy efficiency projects.\n\nThe Prime Minister also committed an additional $135.4 million over the next five years for exploration services, searching for new oil, natural gas and geothermal reserves.",

Aer Lingus also have options of six more A350s to exercise by 2018.\n\nAer Lingus already operates an all-Airbus fleet consisting of 30 short-haul aircraft( 24 A320s and 6 A321s) and eight long-haul A330s, and had made the purchase of new long-haul airliners a top priority since the formerly state-owned company was floated on British and Irish stock markets in September 2006. The airline had approached Airbus rival Boeing regarding a potential deal for their new 787 aircraft, but Aer Lingus Chief Executive Dermot Mannion stated that he believed the Airbus aircraft were “better on fuel and better on range” than the 787. He also said that, although the aircraft have a catalogue value of €1.78 billion (US$2.4 billion), Airbus had offered them at an \"exceptional discounts” on them. Some of the A330s will be replaced by the new aircraft.\n\nAs well as new routes to the US, Mannion stated that there was a possibility of routes elsewhere resulting from the new aircraft as well, saying, “We will prioritize the U.S. (but) we have an eye as to what's happening to the Far East and South Africa.” The airline already offers flights to New York, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dubai, and recently launched 3 new U.S. routes to San Francisco, Orlando, and Washington.\n\nAer Lingus shares on the Irish Stock Exchange fell 2.5 percent to €2.73 ($3.68) the day the deal was announced. It will fall through unless backed by shareholders.\n\nAer Lingus rival Ryanair has been attempting to take over Aer Lingus since December, and if this bid is successful, the new aircraft may become redundant as Ryanair intends to end transatlantic services. However, the Irish government, which holds a 25 percent share in Aer Lingus, disapproves of the takeover, as do Aer Lingus employee-controlled trusts that hold more than 15 percent shares. Ryanair owns a 25 percent share in Aer Lingus. The takeover is also unlikely to receive regulatory approval from the European Union.\n\nMannion said of the integration of the new aircraft \"The A350 XWB fits in with our ambitious plans to expand existing routes and to open up new ones from our hub in Dublin. We already have an all Airbus fleet and the new aircraft will fit in seamlessly.\"",

He attended Corpus Christi College in Cambridge, where, in 1924, he was awarded the Chancellor's Medal for English Verse. He was attending the college on a history scholarship he received in 1922.\n\nUpward joined the communist party in 1932 after the fall of Britain's Labour Party in the summer of 1931. He recalls joining the party because he felt \"psychological need\" so satisfy his imagination of it. He was convinced his fear of becoming mentally unstable would be cured, because his cousin Allen, who was also an author, killed himself after going crazy. Upward stated he was impressed with his cousin's suicide, because he thought he would die the same way.\n\nUpward's first novel Journey to the Border, was published by the Hogarth Press in 1938.

The ships involved in this rescue operation were a commercial tugboat, a barge, 6 pleasurecraft, an Alaska Marine Highway ferry, and another cruise ship.\n\nAs of 1:00 PM Eastern Time, all of the passengers have been transferred to an Alaskan Ferry, heading back to Juneau.

    "original_text": "Iran\nIranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called on the United States to substantially change its foreign policy toward Iran in an address aimed at the new Barack Obama administration.\n\nIn addition to urging a new direction in foreign policy, Ahmadinejad demanded that the US apologize for the \"crimes they have committed against the Iranian nation\" over the past 60 years. Ahmadinejad says these \"dark crimes\" include the economic sanctions imposed since the country's 1979 revolution, attempts to halt Iran's nuclear program, and America's support of Israel.\n\n\"Those who speak of change must apologize to the Iranian people and try to repair their past bad acts and the crimes they committed against Iran,\" the president said in the city of Kermanshah. The remarks were Ahmadinejad's first address to the US since Obama took office on January 20, though he did congratulate Obama after his election in November.\n\nAhmadinejad singled out the George W. Bush administration for its support of Israel and its expansion of US military presence around the world. He called for an end to \"interfering in other people's affairs\", which meant a withdrawal of all US troops. \"If someone wants to talk with us in the language that Bush used,\" he said, \"even if he uses new words, our response will be the same that we gave to Bush during the past years\".\n\nThough the Iranian president did not mention Obama by name, he did have a lot to say about his predecessor. \"Mr. Bush has gone into the trash can of history with a very black and shameful file full of treachery and killings,\" Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying. \"He left and, God willing, he will go to hell.\"\n\nThe remarks came a day after President Obama made a much-publicized appearance on Al Arabiya, an Arabic news channel. During the interview, Obama repeated a theme from his inauguration speech, saying \"if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us\". Diplomacy will be a very important tool in US relations with Iran, he clarified.\n\nIt is not clear if Ahmadinejad's speech was meant as a response to Obama's interview, but some of his remarks seemed to echo Obama's campaign theme of \"change\". Ahmadinejad said there are two types of change he could expect from Washington. \"First is a fundamental and effective change,\" he said. \"The second ... is a change of tactics.\" He said Iran would welcome change from the US, but only if it were \"truly serious and basic\".\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad\nAhmadinejad offered his own definition of change. \"Change means giving up support for the rootless, uncivilized, fabricated, murdering... Zionists and let the Palestinian nation decide its own destiny,\" he was quoted as saying. \"Change means putting an end to U.S. military presence in the world.\" He said Iran will be \"waiting patiently\" and carefully studying the new administration's actions to see if such change takes place.\n\nDo you think that President Obama's is engaging Iran diplomatically? What do you think of President Ahmadinejad's response?Obama campaigned on a promise to introduce diplomacy into US-Iranian relations, but it remains to be seen if either side will be willing to engage in diplomacy. Other US officials seemed to reflect a more conciliatory tone towards Iran than the previous administration. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that Iran has a \"clear opportunity\" to engage with the international community.\n\nUS ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice pledged \"direct\" support to Iran only if it halts its controversial nuclear program, which Iran insists is for peaceful energy purposes.\n\nEven if Ahmadinejad is willing to talk with the US, any decision on foreign relations will require the approval of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, who said in October that hatred of America runs deep in Iran. However, opposition politician Ebrahim Yazdi is somewhat optimistic regarding the prospect of diplomacy, believing better ties with the US are in Iran's economic and political interest. \"The political atmosphere in Iran is now ripe, is suitable for direct negotiation with the United States,\" he said.",

    "original_text": "The live presidential video teleconference held Thursday by George Bush with U.S. troops stationed in Iraq drew fire from critics and even some Pentagon military leaders. Pentagon officials defended the teleconference, saying that the soldiers stated their own opinions.\n\nAn on-camera shot before the teleconference went live showed Allison Barber, the deputy assistant defense secretary, coaching 10 soldiers on broad topics to which the president would want questions directed; then rehearsed their actions on camera and reminded them of what questions were assigned to each soldier.\n\n\"OK, so let's just walk through this,\" Barber said. \"Captain Kennedy, you answer the first question and you hand the mike to whom?\"\n\n\"Captain Smith,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"Captain. Smith? You take the mike and you hand it to whom?\" she asked.\n\n\"Captain Kennedy,\" the soldier replied.\n\nLater on in the discussion:\n\n\"If the question comes up about partnering — how often do we train with the Iraqi military — who does he go to?\" Barber asked.\n\n\"That's going to go to Captain Pratt,\" one of the soldiers said.\n\nDuring the live conference, when asked about Iraq's preparations for their constitutional referendum, 1st Lt. Gregg Murphy of Tennessee said: \"Sir, we are prepared to do whatever it takes to make this thing a success. ... Back in January, when we were preparing for that election, we had to lead the way. We set up the coordination, we made the plan. We're really happy to see, during the preparation for this one, sir, they're doing everything.\"\n\nWhen asked about Iraq's training of security forces, Master Sgt. Corine Lombardo from Scotia, N.Y., a Public Relations officer at the 42nd Infantry Division HQ, said to Bush: \"I can tell you over the past 10 months, we've seen a tremendous increase in the capabilities and the confidences of our Iraqi security force partners. ... Over the next month, we anticipate seeing at least one-third of those Iraqi forces conducting independent operations.\"\n\nThe event was coordinated with the Department of Defense, according to White House press secretary Scott McClellan. \"I think all they were doing was talking to the troops and letting them know what to expect,\" he said. He also said that the troops were expressing their own thoughts. With satellite feeds, coordination often is needed to overcome technological challenges, such as delays, he said.\n\nLater, Pentagon officials denied that the conference was staged. Pentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said \"On behalf of these fine young men and women, we certainly regret any perception that they were told what to say. It is not the case,\" adding that \"The soldiers were advised as to the issues they should expect to discuss, and decided among themselves who would speak to each issue as it may arise.\"\n\nThe director of Operation Truth, a New York-based advocacy group for U.S. veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, described the event as a \"carefully scripted publicity stunt\".\n\n\"If he wants the real opinions of the troops, he can't do it in a nationally televised teleconference,\" Paul Rieckhoff said. \"He needs to be talking to the boots on the ground and that's not a bunch of captains.\"\n\nSgt Ron Long, one of the troops interviewed, denied that it was scripted on his blog, writing \"First of all, we were told that we would be speaking with the President of the United States, our Commander-in-Chief, President Bush, so I believe that it would have been totally irresponsible for us NOT to prepare some ideas, facts or comments that we wanted to share with the President.\n\n\"We were given an idea as to what topics he may discuss with us, but it's the President of the United States; He will choose which way his conversation with us may go.\n\n\"We practiced passing the microphone around to one another, so we wouldn't choke someone on live TV. We had an idea as to who we thought should answer what types of questions, unless President Bush called on one of us specifically.\"",

    "original_text": "A report published last week in the Toronto Star by Professor Michael Geist of Canada's University of Ottawa claims a copyright case under the Class Proceedings Act of 1992 may see the country's largest players in the music industry facing upwards of 6 billion in penalties.\n\nThe case is being led by the family and estate of the late jazz musician Chet Baker; moving to take legal action against four major labels in the country, and their parent companies. The dispute centres around unpaid royalties and licensing fees for use of Baker's music, and hundreds of thousands of other works. The suit was initially filed in August last year, but amended and reissued on October 6, two months later. At that point both the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency (CMRRA) and Society for Reproduction Rights of Authors (SODRAC) were also named defendants.\n\nJanuary this year SODRAC and CMRRA switch sides, joining Baker et al. as plaintiffs against Sony BMG Music, EMI Music Canada, Universal Music Canada and Warner Music Canada. David A. Basskin, President and CEO of CMRRA, with a professional law background, stated in a sworn affidavit that his organisation made numerous attempts over the last 20 years to reduce what is known as the \"pending list\", a list of works not correctly licensed for reproduction; a list of copyright infringements in the eyes of the Baker legal team.\n\nThe theoretical principle of the list is to allow timely commercial release while rights and apportionment of monies due are resolved. Basskin complains that it is \"economically infeasible to implement the systems that would be needed to resolve the issues internally\". And, \"... for their part, the record labels have generally been unwilling to take the steps that, in the view of CMRRA, would help to resolve the problem.\"\n\nThe Baker action demands that the four named major labels pay for and submit to an independent audit of their books, \"including the contents of the 'Pending Lists'\". Seeking an assessment of gains made by the record companies in \"failure or refusal to compensate the class members for their musical works\", additional demands are for either damages and profits per the law applicable in a class action, or statutory damages per the Copyright Act for copyright infringement.\n5=Affidavit supporting class action\n\nThis forms the basis for Professor Geist's six billion dollar calculation along with Basskin's sworn testimony that the pending lists cover over 300,000 items; with each item counted as an infringement, the minimum statutory damages per case are CA$500, the maximum $20,000.\n\nBasskin's affidavit on behalf of CMRRA goes into detail on the history leading up to the current situation and class action lawsuit; a previous compulsory license scheme, with poor recordkeeping requirements, and which, had a decline in real terms to one of the lowest fees in the world, was eventually abolished and the mechanical license system introduced. The CMRRA went on to become a significant representative of music publishers and copyright holders, and the pending list an instrument to deal with situations where mechanical rights were as-yet not completely negotiated. Basskin's affidavit claiming the list grew and circumstances worsened as time progressed.\n\nThe Mechanical Licensing Agreement (MLA) between the \"majors'\" industry body, an attached exhibit to the affidavit, is set to expire December 31, 2012; this is between CMRRA and the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). With the original MLA expiring at end September 1990, CMRRA negotiated more detailed terms and a \"code of conduct\". Subsequent agreements were drawn up in 1998, 2004, 2006, and 2008.\n\nBasskin asserts that the named record company defendants are the \"major\" labels in Canada and states they \"are also responsible for creating, maintaining and administering the so-called \"Pending Lists\" that are the subject of the current litigation\"; that, specific to publishing, divisions of the four represent the \"'major' music publishers active in Canada\". Yet the number of music publishers they represent has decreased over time due to consolidation and defection from the CRIA.\n\nGeist summarizes the record company strategy as \"exploit now, pay later if at all\". This despite the CMRRA and SODRAC being required to give lists of all collections they represented to record labels, and for record labels to supply copies of material being released to permit assessment of content that either group may represent interested parties for. Where actual Mechanical License Agreements are in place, Basskin implies their terms are particularly broad and preclude any party exercising their legal right to decline to license.\n\nSpecific to the current Mechanical Licensing Agreement (MLA) between the CMRRA and the CRIA; a \"label is required to provide an updated cumulative Pending List to CMRRA with each quarterly payment of royalties under the MLA.\" The CMRRA is required to review the list and collect where appropriate royalties and interest due. Basskin describes his first encounter with pending lists, having never heard of them before 1989, thus:\n...In the early years of my tenure, CRMMA received Pending Lists from the record labels in the form of paper printouts of information. The information contained on these lists varied from record label to record label, ... in fact, within a few days after my arrival at CMRRA, I recall my predecessor, Paul Berry, directing my attention to a large stack of paper, about two feet high. and informing me that it was PolyGram's most recent Pending List. Prior to that introduction I had never heard of Pending Lists.\n\nAlain Lauzon, General Manager of Canada's Society for Reproduction Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers (SODRAC) submitted his followup affidavit January 28, 2009 to be attached to the case and identify the society as a plaintiff. As such, he up-front states \"I have knowledge of the matters set out herein.\" Lauzon, a qualified Chartered Accountant with an IT specialisation, joined SODRAC in 2002 with \"over 20 years of business experience.\" He is responsible for \"negotiation and administration of industry-wide agreements for the licensing of music reproduction and distribution\"; licensing of radio and online music services use is within his remit.\n\nLauzon makes it clear that Baker's estate, other rightsholders enjoined to the case, SODRAC, and CMRRA, have reached an agreed settlement; they wish to move forward with a class proceeding against the four main members of the CRIA. He requests that the court recognise this in relation to the initially accepted case from August 2008.\n5=CMRRA\nThe preamble of the affidavit continues to express strong agreement with that of David Basskin from CMRRA. Lauzon concurs regarding growing use of \"pending lists\" and that \"... record labels have generally been unwilling to take the steps that would help to resolve the Pending List problem.\"\n\nWith his background as an authority, Lauzon states with confidence that SODRAC represents \"approximately 10 to 15% of all musical works that are reproduced on sound recordings sold in Canada.\" For Quebec the figure is more than 50%.\n\nLauzon agrees that the four named record company defendants are the \"major\" labels in Canada, and that smaller independent labels will usually work with them or an independent distribution company; and Basskin's statement that \"the responsibility to obtain mechanical licenses for recordings manufactured and/or released in Canada falls with the Canadian labels by law, by industry custom, and by contractual agreement.\"\n\nWikinews attempted to contact people at the four named defendant CRIA-member record labels. The recipient of an email that Wikinews sent to Warner Brothers Canada forwarded our initial correspondence to Hogarth PR; the other three majors failed to respond in a timely fashion. Don Hogarth responded to Wikinewsie Brian McNeil, and, without addressing any of the submitted questions, recommended a blog entry by Barry Sookman as, what he claimed is, a more accurate representation of the facts of the case.\nI am aware of another viewpoint that provides a reasonably deep explanation of the facts, at www.barrysookman.com. If you check the bio on his site, you’ll see that he is very qualified to speak on these issues. This may answer some of your questions. I hope that helps.\nSookman is a lobbyist at the Canadian Parliament who works in the employ of the the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). Hogarth gave no indication or disclosure of this; his direction to the blog is to a posting with numerous factual inaccuracies, misdirecting statements, or possibly even lies; if not lies, Sookman is undoubtedly not careful or \"very qualified\" in the way he speaks on the issue.\n\nSookman's blog post opens with a blast at Professor Geist: \"his attacks use exaggeration, misleading information and half truths to achieve his obvious ends\". Sookman attempts to dismiss any newsworthiness in Geist's article;\n... As if something new has happened with the case. In fact, the case was started in August 2008 (not October 2008 as asserted by Prof. Geist). It also hasn’t only been going on “for the past year”, as he claims. Chet Baker isn’t “about to add a new claim to fame”. Despite having started over a year and a half ago, the class action case hasn’t even been certified yet. So why the fervour to publicise the case now?\nShould the court use admitted unpaid amounts, or maximum statutory damages &amp;ndash; as the record industry normally seeks against filesharers?\nAs the extracted see right stamp, date, and signature, shows, the court accepted amendments to the case and its submission, as Professor Geist asserts, on October 6. The previously mentioned submissions by the heads of CMRRA and SODRAC were indeed actions within the past year; that of SODRAC's Alain Louzon being January 28 this year.\n\nSookman continues his attack on Professor Geist, omitting that the reverse appears the case; analysis of his blog's sitemap reveals he wrote a 44-page attack on Professor Geist in February 2008, accusing him of manipulating the media and using influence on Facebook to oppose copyright reform favourable to the CRIA. In the more current post he states:\nProf. Geist tries to taint the recording industry as blatant copyright infringers, without ever delving into the industry wide accepted custom for clearing mechanical rights. The pending list system, which has been around for decades, represents an agreed upon industry wide consensus that songwriters, music publishers (who represent songwriters) and the recording industry use and rely on to ensure that music gets released and to the market efficiently and the proper copyright owners get compensated.\nThis characterisation of the pending list only matches court records in that it \"has been around for decades\". CMRRA's Basskin, a lawyer and industry insider, goes into great detail on the major labels resisting twenty years of collective societies fighting, and failing, to negotiate a situation where the labels take adequate measures to mechanically license works and pay due fees, royalties, and accrued interest.\n\nWhat Sookman clearly overlooks is that, without factoring in any interest amounts, the dollar value of the pending list is increasing, as shown with the following two tables for mid-2008.\n\nAs is clear, there is an increase of C$1,101,987.83 in a three-month period. Should this rate of increase in the value of the pending list continue and Sony's unvalued pending list be factored in, the CRIA's four major labels will have an outstanding debt of at least C$73 million by end-2012 when the association's Mechanical Licensing Agreement runs out.",

    "original_text": "In findings published on Monday in Scientific Reports, scientists from the University of Vienna and Vienna Natural History Museum, Austria found the stone used to carve the Venus of Willendorf came from northern Italy, hundreds of miles from its origin, on the other side of the Alps.\n\nThe 30 thousand-year-old sculpture is one of the oldest examples of human art. It stands about 4.3 tall. Like many prehistoric statuettes, it shows a female figure with a large stomach and breasts. However, while most of these other examples were carved from ivory or bone, the Venus is made of a stone called oolite, a type of limestone. Scientists believe it was carved by people of the Gravettian culture, probably with flint tools. Scientists named it after Venus, the Roman goddess of love.\n\nScientists compared rock samples from as west as France and as east as Ukraine to microscopic views of the Venus. Because oolite is a sedimentary rock formed by layers of silt and other materials building up over time, it is possible to discern individual grains and bits of shell that make up the stone. One of the tiny shell fragments in the statue came from a creature that lived during the Jurassic period, though the stone itself would have been harvested and carved much later.\n\nUnlike previous examinations of the Venus, which evaluated only the exterior of the work, scientists used computed tomography to look inside the statue without damaging it. The scan showed the Venus had little resemblance with oolites near Willendorf, but that it was almost identical to those from Lake Garda in Italy, on the other side of the Alps and the Danube river, over 350 away. A less possible site of origin is in Ukraine, over 1600 east of where the statue was found in 1908, in Wachau, Austria.\n\nLead author Gerhard Weber speculated the stone may have moved during a migration: \"When the climate or the prey situation changed, people moved on, preferably along rivers,\" he said.\n\nThe scientists say these findings have implications for the way prehistoric humans in and around the Alps traveled from place to place.\n\nThe study was funded by the state of Lower Austria.",

    "original_text": "Yesterday, Richard Porter, an editor from BBC News, wrote a blog entry to respond to a controversy that has erupted overnight in the blogosphere. \"We're not part of a conspiracy,\" he assures his readers. \"We didn't get told in advance that buildings were going to fall down. We didn't receive press releases or scripts in advance of events happening.\"\n\nAt the heart of the controversy is a video that surfaced on Google Video and YouTube. It is a segment taken from the BBC's own of their news coverage of the events of September 11. In it, reporter Jane Standley reports the complete unexpected collapse of WTC 7. However, she presented this information half an hour before it actually happened. In fact, while she is reporting the demise of WTC 7, it is clearly visible right behind her. During the course of the broadcast, the studio loses the connection with her, and when she returns, the building is gone.\n\nDuring the first part of the broadcast, she gives specific details about the building, how many floors it has, who owns &amp; leases it, and the fact that nobody was inside at the time of the collapse. All of these facts that Ms. Standley presented were 100% accurate.\n\nIn Porter's 5-point response to the accusations, he insists that his organization was the victim of chaos, not conspiracy. Unfortunately, Porter says, none of the reporters involved remember exactly what happened, and they have lost all of the original tapes, making it impossible to check. Porter explains that \"like everybody else that day she was trying to make sense of what she was seeing; what she was being told; and what was being told to her by colleagues in London who were monitoring feeds and wires services.\"\n\nHe concludes that, at worst, they simply made an error &amp;mdash; an error that happened to be prophetic. He signs off by quoting a flippant comment from YouTube: \"so the guy in the studio didn't quite know what was going on? Woah, that totally proves conspiracy... \".\n\nDirectly beneath Porter's blog are two-dozen comments from BBC News readers. The comments are less than appreciative.",

Earlier in the week other lawsuits were filed in relation to the incident; in all cases the named defendants are the same.\n\nThe Tak Bai incident is one of the most publicised events of the South Thailand insurgency. On October 25, 2004 six local men were arrested, accused of supplying defence force weapons to insurgents. Villagers organised a protest, demanding that the police release the accused. Instead, the police called in army reinforcements who used tear gas and water cannons on the crowd; shooting started, and seven people were killed.\n\nHundreds of local citizens, mostly young Muslim men, were arrested. They were made to strip to the waist and lie on the ground. Their hands were bound behind their backs and later in the afternoon they were loaded into trucks to be taken to an army camp where they were to be detained. The prisoners were stacked on top of each other in the trucks, and by the time the three-hour trip to the camp was completed, 78 men had suffocated in the heat.\n\nThe incident provoked widespread protest, not limited to Muslims in the south. Many non-Muslim Thais were shocked by the army's behaviour. However the Thai Prime Minister, Thaksin Sinawatra, gave his full support to the army and until these lawsuits were brought, very little disciplinary action had been taken against those responsible. Thaksin's response in defending the army's actions was to say the men died, \"because they were already weak from fasting during the month of Ramadan.\"\n\nThe lawsuits brought earlier this week against the five state agencies seek a total of more than eighteen million baht (approx. US$ 440,000 or 370,000 euros) in compensation. The first lawsuit was filed on behalf of relatives of five of the seven protesters killed outside Tak Bai police station; this suit seeks 5.8 million baht. The second lawsuit was filed by a group of seventeen of the protesters who were injured in the clash with police and security forces; this suit seeks 12.4 million baht compensation for injury and loss of property. All of the lawsuits have been brought with the assistance of the Law Society of Thailand.\n\nThe aftermath of the Tak Bai incident saw many of the protesters seeking asylum in neighbouring Malaysia. Recently forty of those who had fled across the border returned after they had been given assurances by authorities regarding their safety.\n\nThe leadership of the insurgents remains unclear, with no clearly identified organisational structure, or announced objectives. However, there have been separatists in the former Malay sultanate since the 1930s. Under military rule, they were firmly suppressed and only since early 2004 has violence flared in the troubled provinces. The government reacted to this by declaring Martial law in January of 2004.\n\nDespite the imposition of Martial law, attacks on police, government officials, schools and military compounds continued unabated. This prompted the Prime Minister to introduce an executive decree for administration in emergency situations early in 2005. Additional troops were dispatched to the troubled provinces bringing the total in the area to 30,000; however, lack of counter-insurgency training and experience meant they have done little in the way of quelling the violence. In the past six months the army has reported that 298 have been killed, and over 300 injured in attacks. The estimated total killed since the start of 2004 is claimed to be over one thousand.",

Ohio Republican Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, President George W. Bush, Vice-President Dick Cheney and White House Political Advisor Karl Rove were subpoenaed for depositions December 28th and 29th in a challenge supported by the Reverend Jesse Jackson. Blackwell has refused to appear, claiming in a court filing that he is not required to be interviewed since he is a high-ranking public official. The lawyer for the other three officials claims that his clients were not properly served the subpoenas.\n\nThe deposition was part of a lawsuit filed at the Ohio Supreme Court challenging the results of the U.S. presidential election in that state. A multi-party recount effort completed on December 28 showed a 300 vote difference between the initial and final tallies, but failed to answer questions about irregularities in the voting process such as shortages of voting machines in minority precincts, problems with electronic voting machines, and statistical improbabilities in reported vote tallies.\n\nIn his court filing, Blackwell further called those asking questions about the vote engaging in 'frivolous conduct' and making too many requests of election officials around the state. Republican Blackwell, as Secretary of State, assigns all members, directors and deputy directors of the precinct boards of elections that run the elections in the state. Challengers to the voting process have questioned whether these boards were adequately run as bipartisan operations, suggesting that since the boards owe Blackwell their jobs, this could have established a pattern of problems that favored Bush at Kerry's expense.",

    "original_text": "An eight year study, published in scientific journal Nature, claims the HIV-1 virus that leads to AIDS could have infected humans around 1908 in Africa. Scientists found traces of the HIV-1 genome collected in 1960 from a woman who lived in Léopoldville, presently called Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. An earlier study had also isolated the virus from a 1959 blood sample of a male from Léopoldville. Study of both the samples and estimate of the rate at which the virus mutates over time has led the researchers to conclude that the human strain could have been around for 100 years.\n\nThe study, co-sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, was carried out by Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona and colleagues from the United States, France, Belgium, Australia, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Denmark.\n4=Michael Worobey, University of Arizona in Tucson\nEarlier estimates of this nature had indicated the first infection in humans occurred between 1915 and 1941. The present study pushes the date of the infection back to sometime between 1884 and 1924, with a more focused estimate at 1908. Earlier studies have suggested that HIV-1 virus was spread from chimpanzees to humans in Cameroon.\n\n\"Now, for the first time, we have been able to compare two relatively ancient HIV strains. That helped us to calibrate how quickly the virus evolved and make some really robust inferences about when it crossed into humans, how the epidemic grew from that time, and what factors allowed the virus to enter and become a successful human pathogen,\" Dr. Worobey said.\n\n\"HIV is one of these pathogens that you could almost think of as living on the edge of extinction,\" Worobey continued. He believes that had HIV not been carried to a city, it may not have survived the jump to humans.\n\n\"It means there are things we could do to actually make it so that it doesn't have a chance of spreading,\" Worobey said.\n\nThe first human infection could have happened around the time when the colonial cities were established in Africa. Rapid urbanization in colonial Africa around the beginning of the twentieth century may be responsible for the spread of the AIDS pandemic. It is estimated that several thousand people were infected by the 1960s. Today, HIV infection is reported in 33 million people and has killed 25 million. Researchers opine that an understanding of the origin and pathways for human infection of the virus could help in developing a vaccine to fight it.",

The concert is located at the site of the 1759 Battle of the Plains of Abraham on which British and French troops battled. Quebec premier Jean Charest dismissed the letter, noting that Quebec superstar Celine Dion does not face criticism when she sings in various nations.\n\nWhen interviewed by Radio-Canada on Thursday, the musician suggested that the protestors \"smoke the pipes of peace and to just put away your hatchets\" and indicated his appearance was a matter of friendship and good will.\n\nMcCartney's performance is among numerous scheduled events marking Quebec City's 400th anniversary this year. Celine Dion is scheduled to perform at the Plains of Abraham next month.",

Friday 6 April is cited by Novosti as a likely, though not definite, date. Another RIA Novosti report written in French and dated March 30 states that the US military command is ready to make an attack during the first fortnight of April, but that any final decision will be made by US political leaders.\n\nThe targets will be \"Iranian nuclear installations\" that will be \"designed to be devastating enough to set Tehran’s nuclear program several years back,\" said the website quoting unnamed Russian intelligence officials.\n\nUnited States forces completed a large-scale series of military exercises in the Persian gulf off the Iranian coastline this week, involving 15 ships, 125 aircraft and 13,000 sailors. Naval commanders said the exercises were meant to demonstrate United States' commitment to security in the region, including keeping sea-lanes open for oil shipment and were defensive in nature.\n\nDespite the claims by the Russian official, Iran does not think that the U.S. can \"pressure\" the U.S. tax payers into another war.\n\n\"U.S. officials are under pressure from Americans. I don't think the U.S. is in a position to mount its pressure on the U.S. taxpayers,\" said Manuchehr Mottaki, Iran's Foreign Minister.\n\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council has called on its member nations - Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, all home to U.S. forces in the region, to not take part in an attack on Iran. Qatar and the Emirates have already said that they would not.\n\n\"Russian intelligence has information that the U.S. Armed Forces stationed in the Persian Gulf have nearly completed preparations for a missile strike against Iranian territory. The Pentagon has drafted a highly effective plan that will allow the Americans to bring Iran to its knees at minimal cost,\" said the unnamed Russian intelligence official as reported by RIA Novosti a Russian based news agency.\n\nThe strike force is allegedly going to be composed of the \"USS Nimitz and its support ships\" which will join forces with the John C. Stennis strike group when it leaves the U.S. on April 2.\n\nAlthough the Nimitz is scheduled to relieve the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, all three ships will remain in the Persian Gulf if the 15 British sailors and marines being detained by Iran are not released and will also remain if any armed conflict begins between the two nations.\n\nThe USS Bataan and USS Boxer will also be part of the strike force.\n\nThe Nimitz strike force will be \"composed of the USS Princeton guided-missile cruiser, four guided missile destroyers – the USS Higgins, USS Chafee, USS John Paul Jones and the USS Pinckney. The strike force is armed with two helicopter squadrons and a special unit for dismantling sea mines and other explosive devices,\" said Debka according to Russian intelligence officials.\n\n Despite the claim, Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov says that the situation will be resolved \"peacefully.\"\n\n\"We are constantly working on how to resolve the situation around the Iranian nuclear program and other conflicts peacefully. This policy is unchanged and we will pursue it in the future,\" said Lavrov.\n\nRussian intelligence officials also say that the recent U.S. military exercise in the Gulf on March 27 was \"practice\" for the strike in April and that it will be up the U.S. \"leadership\" to give the go ahead as by April, the military is expected to be ready for the strike.\n\nDifferent sources agree that the attack is allegedly only going to take place by air and will last 12 hours. No attack by land is expected. The attack is allegedly going to be called \"Operation Bite.\"\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry refuses to comment on the reports.",

    "original_text": "United Kingdom\nFour officers from London's Metropolitan Police went on trial today accused of repeatedly beating a Muslim arrested on suspicion of helping \"terrorist organisations operating abroad.\" The men deny assaulting Babar Ahmad, 36, in his home, in a police van and in a police station.\n\nThe assault charges stem from the December 2003 arrest in the city's south-west. Less than a year earlier a similar operation in Manchester had seen an officer stabbed to death by a suspect now serving life in prison. Jonathan Laidlaw, prosecuting, told the jury in Southwark Crown Court the officers had likely been informed Ahmad had militant training and involvement in overseas fighting. The police team was from the specialist Territorial Support Group.\n4=Custody sergeant\nWhilst acknowledging fears Ahmed, who was released without charge, could pose a threat, Laidlaw rejects this actually being the case upon arrival at his home. Woken from sleeping beside his wife at 05:00 by calls of \"police, police\", \"dressed only in his pyjamas and barefooted, Mr Ahmad raised his arms above his head to indicate that he was not going to fight or to present any sort of danger or threat to the police,\" claims Laidlaw.\n\nPolice Constable Roderick James-Bowen, 40, was first into the room and knocked Ahmed back into a window, breaking it. Laidlaw had \"no complaint\" about this action but when \"entirely submissive\" Ahmed was handcuffed \"the defendants subjected him to a sustained and very violent assault - in effect they gave him a beating or they beat him up.\"\n\nThe prosecutor contends the four officers - PC James-Bowen alongside PCs Nigel Cowley, 33, and Mark Jones, 43, and Detective Constable John Donohue, 36 - \"punched and beat Ahmed on the floor\". The accused are said to have called Ahmed a \"fucking bastard\" and a \"fucking cunt\". \"On the floor the assault continued as his wife called out for the police to stop,\" Laidlaw continued. This was followed, he claims, by a visit to Ahmed's prayer room, where he was positioned as if praying and asked \"Where is your god now?\"\n\nAs part of the investigation into suspicions Amhed led a group \"providing logistical support, financial assistance, recruits and computer expertise\" to foreign militant groups, MI5 bugged the house. The jury was played a ten minute recording covering the arrest in which shouts, screams and apparent muffled commands were heard.\n\nThere followed a transfer via police van to Charing Cross police station. In the back of the van \"the officer sitting nearest to Mr Ahmad's head asked him where he was born and when he replied London, that officer punched him in the back of the head. The same officer then lifted Mr Ahmad's upper body and held him in a headlock with both arms. After releasing him the officer said: 'You fucking cunt, you'll remember this day for the rest of your life.'\"\n4=Jonathan Laidlaw, prosecuting\nAt the police station Ahmed says he was led to an area unviewed by CCTV cameras and punched and kicked. He was presented in \"a collapsing state\" to the custody sergeant who was told Ahmed had been violent and resisted arrest. However, the custody sergeant was quoted in court as hearing screams at the police station. \"I would describe the screaming as what I believed was a man and that he was in prolonged discomfort and pain. It was definitely the sound of pain and not of him shouting out,\" Laidlaw quoted the sergeant.\n\nThe officers are accused by the prosecution of having \"lied\" about any resistance offered by Ahmed, who was left with \"areas of bruising, reddening and grazes to his head and neck, bruising to the chest, areas of bruising to his back, extensive bruising and grazing of the arms. In effect, there were injuries all over the victim's body.\"\n\nAhmed was re-arrested in 2004 and has spent the last seven years in custody facing extradition to the US. The US seeks to try him for fundraising for militancy amid claims he is a member of al-Qaeda; though initially a ruling in favour of extradition was reached an appeal is pending.",

    "original_text": "When a fan connects with a band, it's often during moments like a drive down a highway at night reflecting on some aspect of his or her life; sitting at home after a fight with a girlfriend; singing in the shower; or celebrating at a party with her friends. Music becomes a soundtrack to an individual's life, and a connection with the musician forms when the listener is able to peg a perfect moment or feeling to a song. Boston-based mega-member rock group Bang Camaro's fan base claims a different level of interaction: they often have learned to play their music before they ever had a moment associated with it. Bang Camaro found fame on the video game Guitar Hero II, where an aspiring rock god uses a guitar-shaped peripheral to play rock music as notes scroll towards him on the screen.\n\nWikinews reporter David Shankbone journeyed to the Bowery Ballroom to talk to the two founding members of Bang Camaro, Alex Necochea and Bryn Bennett. But when MTV.com shows up at the same time as Wikinews to do an interview, the band must split up. Below is our conversation with Necochea about touring, influence, politics, throwing his corpse out of a plane and flatulent women.\n\n----\n\nDavid Shankbone: How's the tour going?\n\n:Alex Necochea: The tours is going great! We just played in Poughkeepsie last night with the OCC house band.\n\nDS: Poughkeepsie, huh?\n:AN: Yeah! Laughs Poughkeepsie, it's kind of a dark town. Not much of a built-in crowd there.\n\nDS: What kind of crowd is there?\n:AN: From what I could tell, we played for a lot of Guitar Hero fans and people who heard about us through friends of friends, or came across us on MySpace. That sort of thing. But for the most part a lot of the kids we meet are anywhere between...well, I guess at a club like that they have to be over 18, but usually they are just much younger kids who are video game fans, who have heard about us through Guitar Hero II.\n\nDS: What's that like to have a fan base that comes from primarily video games? Have you noticed a difference between being known as a local band playing in your city and being known through video games? How would you compare the audience?\n:AN: It's different. In our hometown it started off as just a big word of mouth thing. We had twenty guys in the band, so everybody had friends-of-friends. We started a groundswell that way. But when we get out of town, not in New York so much, but when we go to Chicago and Milwaukee and places like that they generally tend to be much younger people. It's a really big thrill for Bryn and I in that we are meeting kids who are just like us: young video game fans, aspiring musicians, usually males who picked up guitars. They come to us and say, 'Nobody plays guitar anymore like you guys do!' or 'My parents used to listen to music like that!' It's just a big thrill for us to meet young kids like that who remind us of ourselves when we were kids.\n\nDS: How does it feel to be looked-up to by the kids, by America's future?\n:AN: Laughs It's terrifying! Laughs\n\nDS: Do you see parents at the show?\n:AN: Oh, yeah, oh yeah. Parents with their kids—\n\nDS: That must reduce the crotch grabbing.\n:AN: Laughs Yeah, a little bit of macho posturing. I tell you man, it's a really big thrill, just to go out and play in towns we've never been to. Kids come out and they know all the songs. We've had situations where we've played New York and girls are in the front row singing along to our guitar solos. Like, wow...we're on stage playing and we can hear them singing back at us. Something else Bryn and I have noticed is at larger festival shows when we get to the end of our shows we play Push Push Lady Lightning, the kids would just light up and start air guitaring! But not actually playing air guitar, but playing air guitar hero--like, they knew where all the notes were!\n\nDS: Which is a lot different for audiences of many bands.\n:AN: Absolutely! I can't imagine other bands having the same experience, because we come from such a unique perspective that a large part of our music is driven by the instrumentals, and that sort of thing.\n\nDS: Your fans are so engaged with your music, far more than most bands have. Most bands they have fans who feel their music speaks to them, but your fans can say, 'I learned to play guitar on your shit and not on Eleanor Rigby!'\n:AN: It's an honor. It's still unbelievable to me. I had a message from a friend of mine who was at Guitar Center and he heard one of the kids cranking out one of our songs when he was trying out the guitar. To me, it's like we made it.\n\nDS: At this point of your career, you're not playing stadiums, but you're also not playing Otto's Tiki Lounge on a Tuesday night. When you reflect upon it, what do you think about?\n:AN: In the past two years, since Bryn and I started this project, we've both been playing in bands locally in Boston for years. We had some mixed success, we played large venues in and around Boston. We got to the point where we said fuck it, we just want to have some fun and we'd laugh a lot going over old Ozzy Osbourne stuff we listened to as kids, just giggle about it. Bang Camaro started that way, something for us to do and invite our friends to come sing on it. Now, just two years later, it's amazing what happens when you stop trying. It's something not contrived or born of any desire to reach an audience. We just did it for fun, and that spoke to people more than anything else we worked on.\n\nDS: Do you have other areas of your life where you've been able to apply that?\n:AN: Laughs You mean as an ethos? Don't try? Laughs You know, not really. I have found the greatest success in the things I have put most of my effort into. This band has been a complete unique experience in that respect, at least in terms of trying to forge a 'career in music.' Bryn and I had gotten to the point where we thought maybe this wasn't the way to go. Bryn was going to go back to his career as a video game programmer and I was just going to find something else to do. So not really, I don't really apply that in any other portion of my life.\n\nDS: What are some dream projects you'd like to work on?\n:AN: As a musician, obviously for me it would be to meet and work with some heroes of mine since I was a kid. Like Mutt Lang; he always made my favorite records. At the same time, it has also been a dream of mine to meet people like Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse. Those guys made honest sort of rock n' roll, for lack of a better comparison, the way people like John Lennon or Bob Dylan would. To me those are the artists of my generation. It would be my dream one just to meet those guys and two just to work with them on some level. I'd also be lying to say that it would just be my dream to take this project with twenty of my best friends and take it as far as we can take it. So far in my life it's been the most rewarding thing.\n\nDS: In the creative process it's so difficult to be original today. Everything has been done. Do you ever let that trip you up, the Simpsons Did It problem?\n:AN: No, not really. I found I would end up falling into that cycle playing in indie rock bands, just trying to come up with the next thing, like Radiohead they stopped using guitars and things like that. Trying to kick the ball forward a little bit instead of kicking it side to side. With this band we don't get hung up on that. We originally just started it as a celebration of the things we loved when we were kids. We're not out here trying to reinvent the wheel. We're fortunate in that when we were putting the project together we wanted that big vocal sound. What set us apart was how we went about doing that. We just invited all of our friends because we didn't want to multi track everything ourselves. Soon after we had to figure out how to pull it off live, and people would approach and say 'we heard you have this crazy project with all these people.' The project grew into the live monster it is out of necessity. We're not rich people, we don't have refrigerators and the big tour bus. Speaking of dreams, maybe one day we'll have a tour bus. For now, we travel in two very smelly vans.\n\nDS: If you could choose your own death, how would you die?\n:AN: Laughs I would want to steal what I heard a mutual friend of ours said. He said when he died--it's not how he died, but this is what I heard--he said when he's dead, he wants his corpse to be dressed up like Superman and thrown out of an airplane. I thought that would be fitting. But I'm not ready to think about death, not just yet.\n\nDS: You guys have been described as Metal and Glam rock. What would you describe your sound as?\n:AN: I would call us anthem rock. We're really not heavy metal. I think our focus is more on writing great singles, as best as we can make them. Pop music. That's just something Bryn and I grew up on. We're big fans of melody and big driving hooks, that sort of thing.\n\nDS: Would you say anthem rock more in the Mötley Crüe vane or more in the T. Rex vane?\n:AN: I would say half and half. Our influences don't just stop with hair metal and things like that. We draw on things like Thin Lizzy, Boston, bands like that. Not necessarily virtuosic sort of musicianship, but things that are put together. We like to spend the time when we are writing our songs that we are taking all the extraneous crap out of it. We just want to make good, hook-drive pop music.\n\nDS: Does the war in Iraq affect you artistically at all?\n:AN: Laughs No, not at all. No, you could say I'm just like everybody else. I read the paper and blogs, and I'm just as horrified as everybody else. I'm definitely not a fan of this war.\n\nDS: If you had to fight in Iraq or Afghanistan, where would you fight?\n:AN: Oh, the fight was definitely in Afghanistan. Iraq was a much different animal.\n\nDS: Are you more inspired by things in nature or things that are man made?\n:AN: I would probably have to go with nature. I'm a student of science. I have a degree in environmental geology. When I was 19/20 years old I went through all the regular existential questions people that age go through: why am I here and my place in the universe, that sort of thing.\n\nDS: Did you answer any of them?\n:AN: Oh, God! I play rock guitar in a twenty man band!\n\nDS: That's important for a lot of people - you see your audience. You're giving a lot of inspiration to a lot of people. You don't know who you might be inspiring to pursue music.\n:AN: Laughs Oh, kids, don't be like me! I would definitely go with nature over man made.\n\nDS: What's your favorite curse word?\n:AN: Fuck.\n\nDS: What's your favorite euphemism for breasts?\n:AN: Big guns.\n\nDS: Have you used that recently?\n:AN: Actually, I think I did use that in the last week, and no comment.\n\nDS: I read that you named the band after fast women and fast cars.\n:AN: Laughs Who told you that? No, Bang Camaro were two words out of the English language that were the two sexiest words we could think of. We put them together and they roll off the tongue. Bang Camaro. It says a lot more than it means.\n\nDS: What sort of qualities do you look for in a woman?\n:AN: I need a girl who is going to make me laugh. I need a woman who is smarter than I am. A woman who will always keep me guessing. Absolutely. Calling me out for my own jerky bullshit. I like a girl who is fiercely independent, knows what she wants, and doesn't need me.\n\nDS: Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama?\n:AN: Oh, man, I'm going to get in a lot of trouble for saying Obama. I would probably go with Obama. There's just something in his rhetoric and his oratory that is a lot more inspiring than Hillary. Hillary, to me, represents not much of a changing of the guard.\n\nDS: What would be the greatest of misfortunes to befall you?\n:AN: Chuckles Oh, if I were to die alone. No, probably one of my greatest fears is injuring or maiming any of my appendages, to be honest.\n\nDS: Do you have any special things you do to make sure you don't injure or lose an appendage?\n:AN: Chuckles I don't keep my hands in my pockets when I am running down stairs.\n\nDS: That's a conscious choice?\n:AN: Yes, that's a conscious choice.\n\nDS: What if you are just walking down stairs?\n:AN: Chuckles You can't realign the stars, man. Shit will happen, shit will happen.\n\nDS: What possession do you treasure most?\n:AN: That's a good question. Probably my cat. I love my cat more than anything.\n\nDS: What's your cat's name?\n:AN: Sadie.\n\nDS: Like Sexy Sadie?\n:AN: Yeah, like Sexy Sadie. That's exactly what I named her after. Big John Lennon fan, so I couldn't resist.\n\nDS: What trait do you deplore most in other people?\n:AN: I'm a lover, not a fighter. Jealousy, greed. But I try to look for the best in everybody. Who knows.\n\nDS: What do you think are the greatest threats to humanity?\n:AN: Humanity itself. You can typically read anywhere that humanity is a virus, a plague, on Mother Earth. I really think the greatest threat to humanity is not a meteor or comet hurtling toward the planet, it's us. We'll be our own undoing. Bad politics, the spread of...oh, man, I could get in trouble...\n\nDS: Who would you get in trouble with?\n:AN: No, I don't know who I could get in trouble with. But I definitely think that capitalism is something that having gone unchecked for so long isn't doing right in delivering civil freedom. It's not delivering on its promises. Then again, I play in a rock band and people come pay to see me. I understand it works on both levels.\n\nDS: What would be a bigger turn-off in bed: a woman who spoke in a baby voice, or someone who was overly flatulent?\n:AN: Oh God! I'd go with the baby talk, man.\n\nDS: You'd prefer the baby talk?\n:AN: No, I would go with the flatulent woman. At least she's real.\n\nDS: Have you ever been faced with either scenario?\n:AN: No, I don't think women should be flatulent.\n\nDS: At all? Not even if she lets out a little giggle afterwards?\n:AN: Yeah, well, so be it.\n\nDS: What if she was really flatulent?\n:AN: Like, extremely flatulent? I'd go more for the flatulence. Baby talk...that's a real boner killer. Sorry, man.\n\nDS: And you've never had a baby talker?\n:AN: No, not since high school.\n\nDS: In high school?\n:AN: Oh, yeah. She had to go.\n\nDS: What if she was Dutch oven flatulent?\n:AN: Is it really one or the other? Can I just go gay?\n\nDS: You can always go gay. It's the new millennium.\n:AN: Yeah, well, I'd probably end up with a baby-talking overly flatulent man, I'm sure.",

    "original_text": "PhilippinesTwin blasts, allegedly caused by improvised explosive devices, rocked two upscale malls in the main financial district in Aguinaldo Street in Iligan City on Thursday. At least three people were killed and forty-seven were wounded when two improvised crude bombs exploded and damaged the Unicity Commercial Center at 1:35 p.m. and the nearby Jerry’s Shoppers Plaza 10 minutes later.\n\nThe mall blasts occurred a day before President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s scheduled visit to the City, her maternal hometown. Lanao del Norte police Superintendent Dimacuta Sanggacala said he \"corrected the earlier report that six people had been killed, saying that some of those whom they thought were dead were seriously hurt.\" \"Forty-five people were injured and being treated at the Sanitarium City Hospital and Dr. Uy City Hospital,\" he added.\n\nThe City of Iligan (Cebuano: Dakbayan sa Iligan; Filipino: Lungsod ng Iligan) is a highly urbanized city North of the province of Lanao del Norte, Philippines, and the province's former capital. It is approximately 795 kilometers southeast of Manila with a population of 308,046 people as of 2007.\n\nThe provincial police said that CCTV video footages from both malls show two men both wearing scarfs, had placed the explosives inside bags and left at the package or baggage counters of the malls. An L-300 van was also destroyed in the blasts. The local SOCO forces, the Explosive Ordnance Disposal team (bomb experts) and the bomb-sniffing K9 unit of the 403rd Brigade were immediately dispatched to search the site for more victims.\n\nCol. Nicanor Dolojan, commander of the Army’s 403rd said that “our suspect here are the lawless MILF group because of the type of the (improvised explosive device) that were used. That IED manifest their signature, using mortar rounds. Terrorism, which is their real intention, to sow terror in the area.That is our initial findings.” Iligan City Mayor Lawrence Cruz said that his local government received several \"threats to bomb establishments - department stores, churches, schools, public places, and markets.\"\n\nContinuous clashes began in August between government troops and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, after the High Court annulled a Memorandum of Agreement on peace. Reuters reported that \"five people were wounded in two blasts on December 4 in another part of Mindanao, which army officials blamed on rogue Muslim rebels fighting a long-running insurgency in the south.\" \"There have been at least three bomb attacks on bus terminals in the south since July as violence escalated after Manila and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the country's largest Muslim rebel group, failed to sign a territory deal in August.\" it added. In November, three people were also injured in the blasts of the Traveler's Inn and the Caprice Lodge in Iligan City.\n\nThe Abu Sayyaf Group (lang-arجماعة أبو سياف; Jamāʿah Abū Sayyāf, ASG), also known as 'al-Harakat al-Islamiyya' is one of several militant Islamist separatist groups based in and around the southern islands of the Philippines, in Bangsamoro (Jolo, Basilan, and Mindanao) where for almost 30 years various Muslim groups have been engaged in an insurgency for a state, independent of the predominantly Catholic Philippines.\n\nThe Times of India reported that \"the southern Philippines region of Mindanao is the hotbed of a decades-old Muslim separatist insurgency that has, in recent years, been suspected of harbouring Islamic militants with ties to the al-Qaida network of Osama bin Laden.\"",

    "original_text": "2012 US Presidential Election\nFormer Salt Lake City, Utah mayor and human rights activist Rocky Anderson announced yesterday at a press conference in Washington, D.C. that he is officially a candidate for the office of President of the United States. He also formally announced the creation of a new third party: the Justice Party, under which he will make his run.\n\nAnderson, who is known as an outspoken advocate of campaign finance reform, immigration reform, and LGBT rights, served as Mayor of Salt Lake City for two terms from 2000 to 2008 as a member of the Democratic Party. During his tenure, he enacted proposals to reduce the city's carbon emissions, reformed its criminal justice system, and positioned it as a leading sanctuary for refugees. Since leaving the office, Anderson has been critical of the Democratic Party and president Barack Obama. Earlier this year, he left the party, faulting it for failing to push impeachment against President George W. Bush, and for not reversing policies on torture, taxes, and defense spending.\n\nTalk of an Anderson presidential run goes back at least five years. According to The Nation, in 2006, after delivering a speech on the steps of city hall, supporters asked Anderson to run for president. He responded \"I'd be torn to pieces\" as a candidate, but \"if I thought I could win, I would run. This country certainly needs leadership.\" Last October, Anderson announced that he wished to create a new political party, and last month, confirmed that he would run for president.\n\nAt yesterday's press conference, which was attended by about 30 people, Anderson remarked, \"We the people are powerful enough to end the perverse government-to-the-highest-bidder system sustained by the two dominant parties...We are here today for the sake of justice — social justice, environmental justice and economic justice.\" The low turnout at the event was attributed to the lack of notice and sufficient planning.\n\nSpeaking of the low turnout, Anderson argued that \"This is what grass roots looks like at the very beginning.\" He says he will limit campaign contributions to $100. He is working to have the Justice Party appear on state ballots in time for the election next November, and hopes to draw support from the Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nAccording to The Salt Lake Tribune, the Justice Party's three primary goals include: the removal of corporate money from politics through a Constitutional amendment, an abolition of the country's two party political system, and the election of Anderson as president. A nominating convention is planned for February 2012.",

With Noise being the only new wide release movie for the weekend, it looks to take advantage of movie goers looking from a change from holiday themed film fare.\n\nNoise is a come-back attempt for Michael Keaton, who hasn't had a hit movie since 1992's Batman Returns. But according to one critic, this film may not be a comeback hit for Keaton.\n\n\"White Noise never gives skeptics a chance to enjoy the film. I also suspect even believers will be bored,\" Jack Garner, film critic for Gannet News Service said. Garner's not alone in panning the film. According to web site RottenTomatoes.com, 87 percent of film critics in its survey have given the film a bad review.\n\n\"The nominal thriller White Noise is worthy neither of Michael Keaton's talents nor even a desperate horror fan's attention,\" Manohla Dargis, film critic for the New York Times, said.\n\nBut not all reviews were bad. Hollywood Reporter critic, Kirk Honeycutt said, \"Even though logic takes a holiday in White Noise, Geoffrey Sax, a British television director making his theatrical debut, lavishes enough craft on the paranormal thriller to send more than a few chills down the spine.\"\n\nThe movie faces stiff competition as five other films have a wider release, playing in more theatres and reaching a larger potential audience. Universal's Meet the Fockers, the sequel to 2000's Meet the Parents is playing in about 1,000 more theatres than Noise and could dominate the box office for a third weekend.\n\n'Fockers', starring Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand, has made $186.5 million since its release Dec. 22, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nThe following films will be playing in at least 1,000 U.S. and Canada venues:",

    "original_text": "Iran\nThursday, United States military forces killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran's Quds Force, in an airstrike. The United States called its actions defensive in nature, pointing to the December 31 attack on the United States Embassy in Baghdad as an example of the attacks on U.S. citizens that Soleimani took part in.\n\nThe United States carried out the airstrike at Baghdad International Airport, where Soleimani was arriving by plane. He was being met by Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was also killed in the airstrike. al-Muhandis was the deputy commander of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an Iranian-backed militia. Other victims included a Kataeb Hezbollah official and Mohammed Reda, an airport protocol officer. The Daily Telegraph, citing local paramilitary groups, reported that the attack consisted of three rockets launched from helicopters.\n\nIn a statement released after the attack, the United States Department of Defense justified the strike, which was approved by President Donald Trump, as \"defensive\" in nature: \"At the direction of the President, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force, a U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. General Soleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. General Soleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more. He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months – including the attack on December 27th – culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel. General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week. This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests wherever they are around the world.\"\n\nThe military strike follows rocket attacks on the United States Embassy in Iraq; Business Insider reported that the rocket strikes were carried out by sympathizers of the PMF. In a statement following the attack, Ahmed al-Assadi, a spokesman for the PMF, blamed both Israel and the United States for the attack. As of January 3, no evidence of Israeli involvement has been reported.\n\nThe Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which includes the Quds Force, declared that Soleimani was \"martyred\" by the airstrike. Sayyid Ali Hosseini Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, ordered three days of public mourning after the strike. In his message, he appreciated Soleimani's lifepath: \"He was a stellar example of those educated and nurtured in Islam and the school of Imam Khomeini (ra). He spent his entire life engaging in jihad in the path of God. Martyrdom was his reward for years of implacable efforts ... Shahid Soleymani is the international face of the resistance and all who have a heart-felt connection to the resistance seek his blood revenge.\"\n\nIn his statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu found the air strike justified and called Trump's order swift, forceful and decisive.\n\nThe United States Embassy in Iraq had suspended operations, and advised U.S. citizens to leave the country immediately in its January 3 security alert. The office asked U.S. citizens not approach the Embassy, and if in need for travel documents, to use the consulate in Erbil.\n\nAdil Abdul-Mahdi, the acting Prime Minister of Iraq, spoke out against the attack, calling it \"an aggression on Iraq as a state, government and people\" as well as a violation of the rules relating to the presence of United States troops in Iraq.\n\nIn 2007, the United States government labeled Soleimani as a terrorist and levied sanctions against him. He was further sanctioned in 2011 in relation to a plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. Last April, the United States Department of State also designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization. The United States had also levied individual sanctions against al-Muhandis.",

He also serves as the Union Minister for Finance, succeeding P. Chidambaram.\n\n\"The 76-year-old Prime Minister is doing fine now. He is conscious, stable, comfortable and is making rapid progress. He also met his family and congratulated all doctors. His ventilator has been taken off and he is breathing on his own. This is an important step,\" said Dr. Ramakant Panda, one of the surgeons, after the 11-hour procedure on Saturday.\n\nAccording to critical care specialist Dr. Vijay D'Silva, who has been entrusted with his post-operative care, Singh has been given a liquid diet since morning including a cup of tea, and was speaking to doctors after the procedure. \"The way you doctors are taking care of me, you should also take care of other people\", Dr. D'Silva, who received his basic medical training in Nagpur and headed the ICU at Mumbai's Jaslok and Lilavati Hospitals before he helped set up the ICU at the ultra-modern Asian Heart Institute, quoted Singh as saying.\n\n\"We started the operation at 7:45 am. The second operation always takes longer and makes it difficult to reach the heart. We did a total of five by-passes to clear multiple blockages in his arteries. Surgery was the long term answer since there were many blockages. We will take the PM out of the breathing machine in the next 2-3 hours and the PM should stay for three days in the ICU and then 4-5 days more in the hospital,\" Drs. Panda and D'Silva explained.\n\nSingh's personal physician and AIIMS cardiac surgeon, Dr. K. S. Reddy, has predicted the PM will be allowed to attend to some official work in two weeks, to most of the duties in four weeks and will be able to resume office in six weeks. \"PM was sent to the Operation Theatre at 6:40 am, surgery was done at 8:45 am and was concluded at 7:30 pm. PM was sent back to the ICU at 8:55 pm,\" said Dr. Reddy.\n\n\"The team has brought about 20 boxes of special equipment with it. Earlier, Dr. K. S. Reddy had discussions with Dr. Panda in connection with the line of treatment to be followed,\" the team of 11 doctors said.\n\nThe team of surgeons made a 6 to 7 inch incision along the scar that marked the PM's 1990 bypass operation, and he was given five grafts. \"The new grafts, all 3 mm long, will last the PM the rest of his life,\" said Dr. Pradyot Kumar Rath from the Asian Heart Institute. \"If the PM could have been so active with all the blockages, he can be even more active now,\" Dr Panda said.\n\nSingh underwent a coronary angiography at the AIIMS hospital on Tuesday and Wednesday and was discharged on Thursday. The tests results revealed multiple arterial blockages and Singh returned to hospital on Friday for pre-surgery tests.\n\nExternal Minister Pranab Kumar Mukherjee, age 73, has been given the charge of Finance Ministry after he held meetings with Congress President Sonia Gandhi and then Prime Minister Singh. Mukherjee said he would meet the Prime Minister because he was going for treatment and when he was abroad, Singh was in hospital. \"These are quite natural things. You should not be unnecessarily worried over and coming here in large numbers,\" he said.\n\nMukherjee has also taken charge over some prime ministerial responsibilities, while Singh recovers, officials and media reports said. But no acting prime minister has been named while Singh is recuperating. Mukherjee will also preside over Cabinet meetings and will further handle coal, environment and forests, including information and broadcasting and finance portfolios.\n\nPranab Kumar Mukherjee, a native of West Bengal, India, is the Minister for External Affairs of India in the Manmohan Singh-led Government of India. A prominent leader of the Indian National Congress in the 14th Lok Sabha, he is known to be a competent party apparatchik, \"a prominent Gandhi family loyalist who did not win a popular election until 2004\".\n\nSingh, a diabetic, underwent a bypass surgery in Britain in 1990 and had an angioplasty in 2004 in Delhi in which stents were introduced in his arteries. He had earlier been operated for a benign enlarged prostate in 2007, and for nerve compression in both wrists in 2006 and cataract removal procedure last year, officials said.\n\nThe Congress Party, which leads the coalition Government, has said that he will remain Prime Minister if Congress and its allies win again. But Congress is reportedly planning to replace him, possibly within two years, with Rahul Gandhi, the 38-year-old son of Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born Congress leader. \"Days are not far off for Rahul Gandhi to become Indian Prime Minister,\" Mr Mukherjee said earlier this month.\n\nRahul is an Indian politician and member of the Parliament of India, representing the Amethi constituency. He is a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family, the most prominent political family in India. He is the son of current Italian-born Congress President Sonia Gandhi, and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1991. Gandhi was 14 years old when his grandmother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by her security guards. His great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the first Prime Minister of India, and his great-great-grandfather Motilal Nehru was a distinguished leader of the Indian independence movement.",

It ordered the \"immediate dispatch of SAR-003 and MCS-3005 vessels and the PCG Islander for aerial surveillance.\" PCG noted the possible overloading of the vessel since the boat's franchise authorized it to carry only 40 passengers and 10 crew members.\n\nIn November, a cargo vessel sank in rough seas north of Cagayan, and passing vessels rescued 16 of 20 passengers. Weeks earlier, separate storms sank two passenger vessels in the central Philippines, drowning more than 50 people.\n\nPrior to the ferry sinking, the Philippine weather bureau had issued Gale warnings to coastal towns, of approaching tropical storm \"Ulysses\" (international codename: Dolphin) from the Pacific with winds of up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) per hour, centered off southeastern Catanduanes, eastern Philippines.",

    "original_text": "Microsoft\nWith development of Microsoft's Internet Explorer 9 (IE9) browser almost complete, Microsoft announced on Friday that it is time for IE6 users to move away from the antiquated 10-year-old browser. Microsoft has replaced it with three newer versions. On a new website, \"The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown\", Microsoft has launched an aggressive campaign to persuade users to stop using IE6 and update to a newer IE. Its goal is to decrease IE6 users to less than one percent.\n\n\"Ten years ago, a browser was born. Its name was Internet Explorer 6. Now that we’re in 2011, in an era of modern web standards, it’s time to say goodbye,\" Microsoft says on \"The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown\".\n\nInternet Explorer's market share is slipping. IE's various versions accounted for 70 percent of the market in 2009; this has dropped to approximately 56 percent today. Mozilla Firefox, its main rival, has been actively increasing its market share while the recently released Google Chrome is also quickly gaining users. PC World's recent analysis of its own web traffic statistics concluded, \"Usually, Internet Explorer is the #2 browser after Firefox, but over the past 30 days it's been #3, a couple of points behind Safari-and nearly tied with Chrome. It might be a statistical blip. But if it isn't, and Chrome continues to surge, IE could fall to fourth place.\"\n\nWeb developers face big problems with IE6. As they design their web pages for the newer browsers with advanced web technology and geared to the newest web core markup language HTML 5, they are forced to accommodate older out-of-date technology to support IE6 users. Also, not mentioned on Microsoft's \"The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown\" site, are the numerous security vulnerabilities putting the browser at risk of being hacked. The Internet security firm Secunia.com, has said that as of March 4, 2011, IE6 has 277 vulnerabilities; 39 percent of these are rated \"highly critical\". Microsoft says that the latest versions of Internet Explorer provide the user with enhanced protection from these attacks and threats.\n\nMicrosoft's Internet Explorer 6 is one of the most successful software products ever as measured by its durability and the massive numbers of people who have used it. IE6 shipped with Windows XP, nearly a decade ago. But it has outlived its usefulness, and Microsoft no longer wants to support it.",

It is a strato-volcano with an active summit lava dome. It has small eruptions every 3-4 years and larger eruptions every 10-15 years. It has produced more pyroclastic flows, popularly known as heat cloud and magma, than any other volcano in the world. The last fatal eruption happened in 1994, killing 60.

According to the local folk-lore the volcano's eruption is the result of spirits being angered by not receiving sufficient offerings or by a disrespectful attitude among the people in slopes. 27,000 locals in 3 villages could be affected by this eruption. Scientists gave a warning of eruption a fortnight back and asked for immediate evacuation. The nearest city is Yogyakarta.

He admitted taking about CAD225,000 in cash from Schreiber in 1993 and 1994, which was after his departure from politics. He also said that the money involved promoting Schreiber's private business dealings.\n\nTo the committee Muroney said: \"When I look back on it today, I realize I made a serious error of judgment in receiving a payment in cash for this assignment even though it was decidedly not illegal to do so. That mistake in judgment was mine alone. I apologize and I accept full responsibility for it. ... I should have declined the offer. I should have insisted that payment be in a more transparent or more accountable manner. By not doing so I inadvertently created an impression of impropriety on the high office I was privileged to hold.\"\n\n\"Do you realize, Mr. Mulroney, that the way in which you acted in this matter did not make it appear that it were a legitimate transaction,\" said MP Serge Ménard of Bloc Québécois.\n\nTwo days earlier, Schreiber testified before the same committee, alleging that Mulroney agreed to accept CAD300,000 to promote a light armored vehicle factory and benefited from the purchase of 34 Airbus aircraft by Air Canada.\n\n\"I never received a cent from anyone for services rendered to anyone in connection with the purchase by Air Canada from Airbus of 34 aircraft,\" Mulroney said, refuting Schreiber.\n\nMulroney also attacked Schreiber's credibility, pointing out that the German could be extradited to his home country where he faces charges. \"He succeeded. He got what he wanted ... he’s sitting in his mansion over in Rockcliffe,\" Mulroney said. \"I think he seriously misled every member of this House ... with this false affidavit.\"\n\nThe committee's investigation will resume in late January, when it is expected to call dozens of witnesses.",

One of the ironies.\nWNIQ The IPC's website doesn't list guides on their medal things. Are they doing that because they don't want &amp;mdash; you realise this is not all about you per se &amp;mdash; Is it because they are trying to keep off the able bodied people to make the Paralympics seem more pure for people with disabilities?\n::Jessica Gallagher: Look, I don't know but I completely disagree if they don't have the guides up there. Because it's pretty plain and simple: I wouldn't be skiing if it wasn't with him. Being legally blind you do have limitations and that's just reality. We're certainly able to overcome most of them. And when it comes to skiing on a mountain the reason I'm able to overcome having 8 per cent vision is that I have a guide. So I think it's pretty poor if they don't have the information up there because he does as much work as I do. He's an athlete as much as I am. If he crashes we're both out. He's drug tested. He's as important as I am on a race course. So I would strongly hope that they would put it up there. Here's Eric!\n::Eric Bickerton: Pleased to met you.\nWNIQ We've been having a great debate about whether or not you've won a medal in women's blind downhill skiing.\n::Eric Bickerton: Yes, I won it. I've got it.\nWNIQ I found a picture of you on the ABC web site. Both of you were there, holding your medals up. The IPC's web site doesn't credit you.\n::Jessica Gallagher: I'm surprised by that.\n::Eric Bickerton: That's unusual, yeah.\nWNIQ One of the things that was mentioned earlier, most delightful about you guys is you were racing and \"we were halfway down the course and we lost communication!\" How does a blind skier deal with...\n::Jessica Gallagher: Funny now. Was bloody scary.\nWNIQ What race was that?\n::Jessica Gallagher: It was the Giant Slalom in Vancouver at the Paralympics. Actually, we were talking about this before. It's one of the unique aspects of wearing headsets and being able to communicate. All the time while we were on the mountain earlier today, Eric had a stack and all he could hear as he was tumbling down was me laughing.\n::Eric Bickerton: Yes... I wasn't feeling the love.\n::Jessica Gallagher: But um... what was the question please?\nWNIQ I couldn't imagine anything scarier than charging down the mountain at high speed and losing that communications link.\n::Jessica Gallagher: The difficulty was in the Giant Slalom, it was raining, and being used to ski racing, I had never experienced skiing in the rain, and as soon as I came out of the start hut I lost all my sight, which is something that I had never experienced before. Only having 8 per cent you treasure it and to lose all of it was a huge shock. And then when I couldn't hear Eric talking I realised that our headsets had malfunctioned because they'd actually got rain into them. Which normally wouldn't happen in the mountains because it would be snow. So it was the scariest moment of my life. Going down it was about getting to the bottom in one piece, not racing to win a medal, which was pretty difficult I guess or frustrating, given that it was the Paralympics.\nWNIQ I asked the standing guys upstairs: who is the craziest amongst all you skiers: the ones who can't see, the ones on the mono skis, or the one-legged or no-armed guys. Who is the craziest one on the slopes?\n::Jessica Gallagher: I think the completely blind. If I was completely blind I wouldn't ski. Some of the sit skiers are pretty crazy as well.\nWNIQ You have full control over your skis though. You have both legs and both arms.\n::Jessica Gallagher: True, but you've got absolutely no idea where you're going. And you have to have complete reliance on a person. Trust that they are able to give you the right directions. That you are actually going in the right direction. It's difficult with the sight that I have but I couldn't imagine doing it with no sight at all.\nWNIQ The two of you train together all the time?\n::Eric Bickerton: Pretty well, yes.\n::Jessica Gallagher: Yes, everything on snow basically is together. One of the difficult things I guess is we have to have that 100 per cent communication and trust between one another and a lot of the female skiers on the circuit, their guide is their husband. That's kind of a trust relationship. Eric does say that at times it feels like we're married, but...\n::Eric Bickerton: I keep checking for my wallet.\n::Jessica Gallagher: ...it's always about constantly trying to continue to build that relationship so that eventually I just... You put your life in his hands and whatever he says, you do, kind of thing.\nWNIQ Of the two sport, winter sports and summer sports person, how do you find that balance between one sport and the other sport?\n::Jessica Gallagher: It's not easy. Yeah, it's not easy at all. Yesterday was my first day on snow since March 16, 2010. And that was mainly because of the build up obviously for London and the times when I was going to ski I was injured. So, to not have skied for that long is obviously a huge disadvantage when all the girls have been racing the circuit since... and it's vice versa with track and field. So I've got an amazing team at the Victorian Institute of Sport. I call them my little A Team of strength and mission coach, physio, osteopath, soft tissue therapist, sport psychologist, dietician. Basically everyone has expertise in the area and we come together and having meetings and plan four years ahead and say at the moment Sochi's the goal, but Rio's still in the back of the head, and knowing my body so well now that I've done both sports for five years means that I can know where they've made mistakes, and I know where things have gone really well, so we can plan ahead for that and prepare so that the things that did go wrong won't happen again. To make sure that I get to each competition in peak tone.\nWNIQ What things went wrong?\n::Jessica Gallagher: Mainly injuries. So, that's the most difficult thing with doing two sports. Track and field is an explosive power; long jump and javelin are over four to six seconds of maximum effort. Ski racing, you are on a course, for a minute to a minute and a half, so it's a speed endurance event. And the two couldn't be further apart in terms of the capabilities and the capacities that you need as an athlete. So one of the big things I guess, after the Vancouver campaign, being in ski boots for so long, I had lost a lot of muscle from my calves so they weren't actually firing properly, and when you're trying to run and jump and you don't have half of your leg working properly it makes it pretty difficult to jump a good distance. Those kind of things. So I'm skiing now but when I'm in a gym doing recovery and rehab or prehab stuff, I've got calf raising, I've got hamstring exercises because I know they're the weaker areas that if I'm not working on at the moment they're two muscle groups that don't get worked during ski. That I need to do the extra stuff on the side so that when I transition back to track and field I don't have any soft tissue injuries like strains because of the fact that I know they're weaker so...\nWNIQ Do you prefer one over the other? Do you say \"I'd really rather be out on the slopes than jogging and jumping the same...\n::Jessica Gallagher: I get asked that a lot. I think I love them for different reasons and I hate them for different reasons so I think at the end of the day I would prefer ski racing mainly because of the lifestyle. I think ski racing is a lot harder than track and field to medal in but I love the fact that I get to come to amazing resorts and get to travel the world. But I think, at the end of the day I get the best of both worlds. By the time my body has had enough of cold weather and of traveling I get to go home and be in the summer and be on a track in such a stable environment, which is something that visually impaired people love because it's familiar and you know what to expect. Whereas in this environment it's not, every racecourse we use is completely different.\nWNIQ I heard you were an average snowboarder. How disappointed were you when you when they said no to your classifications?\n::Jessica Gallagher: Very disappointed! For Sochi you mean?\nWNIQ Yes\n::Jessica Gallagher: Yeah. I mean we weren't really expecting it. Mainly because they've brought in snowboard cross, and I couldn't imagine four blind athletes and four guides going down the same course together at the same time. That would be a disaster waiting to happen. But I guess having been a snowboarder for... as soon as we found snowboarding had been put in, I rang Steve, the head coach, and said can we do snowboarding? When I rang Steve I said, don't worry, I've already found out that Eric can snowboard. It would have been amazing to have been able to compete in both. Maybe next games.\nWNIQ So you also snowboard?\n::Eric Bickerton: Yes.\nWNIQ So she does a lot of sports and you also do a crazy number of sports?\n::Eric Bickerton: Uh, yeah?\nWNIQ Summer sports as well as winter sports?\n::Eric Bickerton: Me?\nWNIQ Yes.\n::Eric Bickerton: Through my sporting career. I've played rugby union, rugby league, soccer, early days, I played for the Australian Colts, overseas, rugby union. I spend most of my life sailing competitively and socially. Snow skiing. Yeah. Kite boarding and trying to surf again.\nWNIQ That's a lot of sports! Does Jessica need guides for all of them?\n::Eric Bickerton: I've played sport all my life. I started with cricket. I've played competition squash. I raced for Australia in surfing sailing. Played rugby union.\nWNIQ Most of us have played sport all our lives, but there's a difference between playing sport and playing sport at a high level, and the higher level you go, the more specialized you tend to become. And here we're looking at two exceptions to that.\n::Eric Bickerton: I suppose that I can round that out by saying to you that I don't think that I would ever reach the pinnacle. I'm not prepared to spend ten years dedicated to that one thing. And to get that last ten per cent or five percent of performance at that level. That's what you've got to do. So I'll play everything to a reasonable level, but to get to that really, really highest peak level you have to give up everything else.\nWNIQ When you go to the pub, do your mates make fun of you for having a medal in women's blind skiing?\n::Eric Bickerton: No, not really.\n::Jessica Gallagher: Usually they say \"I love it!\" and \"This is pretty cool!\"\n::Eric Bickerton: We started at the Olympics. We went out into the crowd to meet Jess' mum, and we had our medals. There were two of us and we were waiting for her mum to come back and in that two hour period there was at least a hundred and fifty people from all over the world who wore our medals and took photographs. My medal's been all over Australia.\nWNIQ Going to a completely different issue, blind sports have three classifications, that are medical, unlike everybody else, who've got functional ability classifications. You've got the only medical ones. Do you think the blind classifications are fair in terms of how they operate? Or should there be changes? And how that works in terms of the IPC?\n::Jessica Gallagher: Yeah. I think the system they've got in place is good, in terms of having the three classes. You've got completely blind which are B1s, less than 5 percent, which are B2, and less than 10 percent is a B3. I think those systems work really well. I guess one of the difficult things with vision impairment is that there are so many diseases and conditions that everyone's sight is completely different, and they have that problem with the other classes as well. But in terms of the class system itself I think having the three works really well. What do you think?\n::Eric Bickerton: I think the classification system itself's fine. It's the one or two grey areas, people: are they there or are they there?\nWNIQ That affected you in Beijing.\n::Jessica Gallagher: Yeah. That was obviously really disappointing, but, ironic as well in that one of my eyes is point zero one of a percent too sighted, so one's eligible, the other's just outside their criteria, which left me unable to compete. Because my condition is degenerative. They knew that my sight would get worse. I guess I was in a fortunate position where once my sight deteriorated I was going to become eligible. There are some of the classes, if you don't have a degenerate condition, that's not possible. No one ever wants to lose their best sight, but that was one positive.\nWNIQ On some national competitions they have a B4 class. Do you think those should be eligible? In terms of the international competition?\n::Jessica Gallagher: Which sports have B4s?\nWNIQ There's a level down, it's not used internationally, I think it's only used for domestic competitions. I know the UK uses it.\n::Jessica Gallagher: I think I... A particular one. For social reasons, that's a great thing, but I think if it's, yeah. I don't know if I would... I think socially to get more Paralympic athletes involved in the sport if they've got a degenerative condition on that border then they should be allowed to compete but obviously... I don't think they should be able to receive any medals at a national competition or anything like that. So I was, after Beijing, I was able to fore-run races. I was able to transition over to skiing even though at that stage I wasn't eligible. So that was great for us. The IPC knew that my eyesight was going to get worse. So I was able to fore-run races. Which was a really good experience for us, when we did get to that level. So I think, with the lack of numbers in Paralympic sport, more that you should encourage athletes and give them those opportunities, it's a great thing. But I guess it's about the athletes realizing that you're in it for the participation, and to grow as an athlete rather than to win medals. I don't think the system should be changed. I think three classes is enough. Where the B3 line is compared with a B4 is legally blind. And I think that covers everything. I think that's the stage where you have low enough vision to be considered a Paralympic sport as opposed to I guess an able bodied athlete. And that's with all forms of like, with government pensions, with bus passes, all that sort of stuff, that the cut off line is legally blind, so I think that's a good place to keep it.\nWNIQ Veering away from this, I remember watching the Melbourne Cup stuff on television, and there you were, I think you were wearing some hat or something.\n::Jessica Gallagher: Yeah, my friend's a milliner. They were real flowers, real orchids.\nWNIQ Are you basically a professional athlete who has enough money or sponsorship to do that sort of stuff? I was saying, there's Jessica Gallagher! She was in London! That's so cool!\n::Jessica Gallagher: There are two organizations that I'm an ambassador for, and one of them is Vision Australia, who were a charity for the Melbourne Cup Carnival. So as part of my ambassador role I was at the races helping them raise money. And that involves media stuff, so that was the reason I was there. I didn't get paid.\nWNIQ But if you're not getting paid to be a sponsor for all that is awesome in Australia, what do you do outside of skiing, and the long jump, and the javelin?\n::Jessica Gallagher: I'm an osteopath. So I finished my masters' degree in 2009. I was completing a bachelor's and a masters. I was working for the Victorian Institute of Sport guiding program but with the commitment to London having so much travel I actually just put everything on hold in terms of my osteo career. There's not really enough time. And then the ambassador role, I had a few commitments with that, and I did motivational speaking.\nWNIQ That's very cool. Eric, I've read that you work as a guide in back country skiing, and all sorts of crazy stuff like that. What do you do when you're not leading Jessica Gallagher down a ski slope?\n::Eric Bickerton: I'm the Chief Executive of Disabled Winter Sports Australia. So we look after all the disability winter sports, except for the Paralympics.\n::Jessica Gallagher: Social, recreational...\nWNIQ You like that? You find it fulfilling?\n::Eric Bickerton: The skiing aspect's good. I dunno about the corporate stuff. I could give that a miss. But I think it is quite fulfilling. Yeah, they're a very good group of people there who enjoy themselves, both in disabilities and able bodied. We really need guides and support staff.\nWNIQ Has it changed over the last few years?\n::Eric Bickerton: For us?\nWNIQ Being a guide in general? How things have changed or improved, have you been given more recognition?\n::Eric Bickerton: No. I don't see myself as an athlete. Legally we are the athlete. If I fail, she fails. We ski the exact same course. But there's some idiosyncrasies associated with it. Because I'm a male guiding, I have to ski on male skis, which are different to female skis, which means my turn shape I have to control differently so it's the same as her turn shape. It's a little bit silly. Whereas if I was a female guiding, I'd be on exactly the same skis, and we'd be able to ski exactly the same all the way through. In that context I think the fact that Jess won the medal opened the eyes to the APC about visual impairment as a definite medal contending aspect. The biggest impediment to the whole process is how the Hell do you get a guide who's (a) capable, (b) available and (c) able to fund himself. So we're fortunate that the APC pushed for the recognition of myself as an athlete, and because we have the medal from the previous Olympics, we're now tier one, so we get the government funding all way through. Without that two years before the last games, that cost me fifteen, sixteen months of my time, and $40,000 of cash to be the guide. So while I enjoyed it, and well I did, it is very very hard to say that a guide could make a career out of being a guide. There needs to be a little bit more consideration of that, a bit like the IPC saying no you're not a medal winner. It's quite a silly situation where it's written into the rules that you are both the athlete and yet at the same time you're not a medal winner. I think there's evolution. It's growing. It's changing. It's very, very difficult.\nWNIQ Are you guys happy with the media coverage on the winter side? Do you think there's a bias &amp;mdash; obviously there is a bias towards the Summer Paralympics. Do the winter people get a fair shake?\n::Eric Bickerton: I think it's fair. It's reasonable. And there's certainly a lot more than what it used to be. Winter sports in general, just from an Australian perspective is something that's not well covered. But I'd say the coverage from the last Paralympics, the Para Winter Olympics was great, as far as an evolution of the coverage goes.\nWNIQ Nothing like winning a medal, though, to lift the profile of a sport.\n::Jessica Gallagher: And I think that certainly helped after Vancouver. Not just Paralympics but able bodied with Lydia Lassila and Torah Bright winning, and then to have Eric and I win a medal, to finally have an Aussie female who has a winter Paralympic medal. I guess there can be misconceptions, I mean the winter team is so small in comparison to the summer team, they are always going to have a lot more coverage just purely based on numbers. There were 160 Australian athletes that were at London and not going to be many of us in Sochi. Sorry. Not even ten, actually.\n::Eric Bickerton: There's five athletes.\n::Jessica Gallagher: There's five at the moment, yeah. So a lot of the time I think with Paralympic sport, at the moment, APC are doing great things to get a lot of coverage for the team and that, but I think also individually, it's growing. I've certainly noticed a lot more over the past two years but Eric and I are in a very unique situation. For me as well being both a summer and a winter Paralympian, there's more interest I guess. I think with London it opened Australia and the word's eyes to Paralympic sport, so the coverage from that hopefully will continue through Sochi and I'll get a lot more people covered, but I know prior to Beijing and Vancouver, compared to my build up to London, in terms of media, it was worlds apart in terms of the amount of things I did and the profile pieces that were created. So that was great to see that people are actually starting to understand and see what it's like.",

    "original_text": "USA\n\nOne month from the February 17 scheduled transition from analog to digital television broadcast in the United States, members of the United States Senate have introduced a bill that would push back the transition four months later, to June 12. This is due to concerns raised about the government's subsidy program for digital TV receiver boxes, which has run out of money with over 1 million televisions in the United States still running on analog.\n\n\"In Minnesota, more than 21% of our households depend exclusively on over-the-air broadcast TV. While the digital TV transition should happen, this delay is necessary to make up for the lack of preparation on the part of the current administration. Unfortunately, after guarantees that the Bush administration would adequately prepare and protect consumers, only in the last few days have they revealed that funding has run out— just weeks before the plug is pulled on analog TV.\" said US Senator Amy Klobuchar, from Minnesota.\n\nSenator Jay Rockefeller, from the state of West Virginia, also led the charge for the bill to be passed. He said in a statement to the media, \"Over 2 million Americans are waiting to receive a coupon to help them offset the cost of equipment that will help them manage the transition. Millions more don't have the proper information they need.\" He also had a concern that “...because this transition is going to hit our most vulnerable citizens — the poor, the elderly, the disabled, and those with language barriers — the hardest.\" This call by Senators has also earned the support of president-elect Barack Obama, who will be inaugurated on Tuesday.\n\nThe government's subsidy program was set up to provide millions of $40 digital converter boxes to people who could not afford to buy a new television or upgrade to satellite or cable transmission. Many people complained that when they received their coupons, they were not able to use them as they had already expired. Currently, approximately 2 million Americans are on a waiting list to receive coupons for these digital converter boxes.\n\nAlthough members in the Senate as well as the president-elect support this idea, many television stations do not. Nat Ostroff, part of the Sinclair Broadcast Group which owns nearly 60 television stations, says that many stations had used a large sum of money to prepare for the transition to digital broadcast and would lose funds if the delay was passed. \"A delay would not be welcome for the broadcast stations themselves,\" he said, \"The sooner we can turn one of them off, in these hard times, the happier everyone would be.\"",

Their case was strengthened by the testimony of a co-conspirator who pleaded guilty in the case and an undercover police officer who said Siraj openly supported Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe jury also heard testimony by a Bangladeshi-born undercover police officer, who met Siraj while infiltrating a Muslim neighborhood as part of an investigation following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nDuring one conversation, Siraj \"complimented\" Osama bin Laden, the officer testified.\n\n\"He said he was a talented brother and a great planner and that he hoped bin Laden planned something big for America,\" said the officer, who testified under an alias because he is still involved in active investigations.\n\n\"The verdict is an important milestone in safeguarding New York against terrorist plotters whether home-grown or foreign,\" said New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly.",

Dublin's Occupy Dame Street was cleared by police while the local council cleared the abandoned Occupy Waterford site.\n\nThe early hours of Thursday saw the Dublin site raided and cleared by Gardai (police). Gardai cited health and safety concerns over the camp, with St Patrick's Day festivities planned. Irish tourism minister Leo Varadkar previously called it \"disappointing\" the campers would not move while the celebrations were ongoing. \"I understand they feel very strongly about their politics but I'm sure they don't want to damage the festival,\" Varadkar said.\n\n\"Our priority is to ensure that all of St Patrick's Day events and celebrations pass off smoothly and that all participants and the large crowds of spectators at the parade can access and egress the parade route without a risk or threat to their health and safety,\" said a Garda statement. They claimed to have asked for \"assistance and co-operation, however this was not forthcoming,\" and said it took hours to clear the site. The clearance began at 3:30 am local time.\n\nA single arrest was made but the individual was released without charge. Around 100 officers cleared the site, which almost filled the plaza before the Central Bank. Cleaners later cleared all signs of the camp. It had been in place since October, but pallets and solid structures replaced the usual tents of Occupy protests earlier this year in response to local weather. Fifteen people who had been staying overnight were removed.\n\n\"We are not stopping any time soon, it's all hands on deck now, we are going to carry on\", vowed protestor Saoirse Bennet, who was on-scene when police arrived.\n\nWaterford City Council yesterday dismantled the empty camp in their city while Gardai looked on. The quayside protest was abandoned after internal disputes; only two youths and a homeless person were found in the 5:30 am raid, but at one stage the protest had 40 residents. Gardai took the youths \"home to their parents,\" said a spokesman. \"The people we found there had nothing to do with Occupy Waterford.\" Needles and drugs were found, but nobody was arrested.\n\nOccupy Galway may be the next to go: After months of tolerance, Galway City Council have claimed \"serious health and safety concerns\" justify legal eviction proceedings if the camp does not pack up voluntarily.

Very sad, with tears in his eyes Pele said that he got surprised when he received the news that his son was arrested because of drugs. During a press conference on Tuesday he said that he doesn't understand why some people use drugs. \"This must not be used as an excuse but you who accompanied my life since the beginning know of my fight against drugs, and you know my effort in making clear that this thing drug is not good for no human being\", he said.\n\nEdinho admitted that he is addicted to marijuana, but denied any involvement in drug traffic or other criminal activities.\n\nEdinho wrote a note and released it through his lawyer today. In the note Edinho said that he \"had no disposition or control of his thoughts, everything in search of satisfaction in drug, marijuana\".\n\nThe note ends saying: \"I realize how wrong and harmful is the way to drugs and I humbly recognize my situation as addicted and I ask help to everyone who loves me, my family, fans and forgive me because at some moment I became a not good example. Thank you, Edinho.\"\n\nAccording to the authorities Edinho is being indicted by association to drug traffic.\n\nThe police operation conducted by Denarc arrested until now 52 persons in São Paulo and Santos. The main suspect is Ronaldo Duarte Barsotti de Freitas, known as Naldinho. He is accused of drug traffic and according to police is involved in a dispute with another two criminal organizations: the Comando Vermelho (Red Command) from Rio de Janeiro and the PCC (Fist Command from Capital) from São Paulo.

The group's representatives stated that in May they will start the production of “DS Therapy”. In this unconventional game, players can see an evaluation of their mental health by answering several light-hearted questions on various topics in the game.\n\nLaunched in Japan, the game will be available on a hand-held DS Player developed by Nintendo.\n\nMark Baldwin, a psychology professor at the McGill University in Montreal, Canada hopes to use games to make people feel good about themselves. Together with his crew, Baldwin hs developed a game called “MindHabits Booster” based on their research in the field of social psychology. The game idea is built upon their observations that they can use repetitive components from video game play to shape humans' perceptions as well as their ways of thinking.\n\nThe researchers working at the University of Rochester outlined that both children and adults play video games because they have several psychological needs like: opportunities for achievement, freedom and a sense of connection.",

The basis for the court's decision was the section of the Swedish constitution relating to freedom of the press. Since the university was a public body, it was obliged to turn over any documents to any citizen upon request unless the document was protected by a specific paragraph in the Secrecy Law.\n\nThe university argued that the material should be protected by a paragraph referring to the confidentiality of information about patients. The courts decided, however, that they could hand over the data (about 70 shelf feet of documents) if they specified a proviso that would preserve confidentiality. The university was thus ordered to first write a proviso (set of conditions) for Kärfve and Elinder and then hand over the data.\n\nGillberg and the other members of the research group refused to comply. They referred to the promise they had given to the participants in their studies that all the data would be kept completely confidential. They also argued that the data was particularly sensitive since the research concerned psychological and psychiatric disorders among children, and that it was impossible to anonymize the data beyond possible identification. When they had pursued all legal avenues without success, someone apparently destroyed the documents in May 2004.\n\nThe Gillberg group received considerable support from other medical researchers and from their university. They felt that important clinical research could be jeopardized unless complete confidentiality could be promised to the patients.\n\nEva Kärfve stated that she was happy with the prosecution and that it would \"strengthen the protection of research in Sweden.\"",

The other three are journalists, there to cover the \"rescue.\"\n\nThe prosecutor in Abéché, Ahmat Daoud, said: \"For the nine French people it is a matter of kidnapping of minors...as well as extortion.\" They face 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\n\"Zoe's Ark\" describes the children as orphans and says that they would have a better life in Europe. \"The team is made up of firemen, doctors and journalists,\" said spokesperson, Christophe Letien, at a news conference. \"It's unimaginable that doubts are being cast on these people of good faith, who volunteered to save children from Darfur.\" However, French news agency CAPA published an interview in which a \"Zoe's Ark\" member said they could not be completely sure the children were orphans in need of help.\n\nAccording to Annette Rehrl, spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, few of the children appear to actually be orphans. \"They keep saying that they want to return to their parents. Most of them are between three and six years old. It’s very difficult to ask three-year-olds their names and where they come from. Also, some children have already changed their names and stories,\" Rehrl said.\n\nFrench officials say that they warned the group against this operation for months. \"Zoe's Ark\" offices in France were searched to see if the group broke French adoption law by promising families that they could adopt and not just host the children.\n\nThe President of Chad, Idriss Déby, says that it is a case of \"kidnap, pure and simple.\" He further suggested that \"Zoe's Ark\" may have sought to supply the children to pedophile rings or use them as donors for organ transplant.\n\nThe European Union is about to deploy a peacekeeping force, which includes French soldiers, along the border between Chad and Sudan.

Nearby buildings have been evacuated, and a large area has been blocked off. There are reports of a very large crater at the scene.\n\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) has officially ruled out terrorism. Grand Central Station was quickly evacuated soon after the incident. Subway lines 4, 5 and 6 have no service in both directions between the 125th Street Station and the Bowling Green Station. 42nd Street Shuttle service has been shut completely.\n\nThe Fire Department of New York (FDNY) received a call at 5:56 p.m. EDT (UTC-4) reporting an explosion. More than 170 firefighters were dispatched to the scene. Witnesses reported that buildings in the nearby area shook. This was a five-alarm response.\n\nAt least 20 people have been reported injured, and one woman, Lois Baumerich, died from a heart attack. Two people are currently in critical condition.\n\nThere are potentially harmful materials at the scene of the explosion and HAZMAT crews are on the scene to clean up debris. There are reports that pipes were wrapped in asbestos, but the air is being tested, and results should be available late Wednesday night.\n\nConEdison Workers are on the scene as well, and it appears that they are working nearby.\n\nEmergency workers are reporting that the situation is not under control. They are still unable to confirm why the pipe exploded due to the inaccessible nature of the scene at the source of the explosion. The pressure of steam has subsided and the air appears to have cleared, revealing the crater. Disruption of electricity in the surrounding area is minimal.\n\nGCT is reported to be reopened at this time. An area was cordoned off and people trapped in the vicinity due to fears of asbestos pollution resulting from the explosion.\n\nAccording to a press conference with the mayor, the pipe involved was built in 1924, and a likely cause of the eruption and explosion was cold water leaking into the pipe, possibly from rain or from a water pipe. A tow truck had fallen into the crater left by the explosion, and the explosion also shattered glass on nearby buildings.",

He took the oath of office with his hand upon a copy of Spain's constitution, which he chose instead of a Bible. \"I promise on my conscience and honour to comply faithfully with the obligations of Prime Minister,\" he said, standing before King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía.\n\nAfter winning the election on March 9, parliament officially voted Zapatero into the position on Friday. An initial vote on Wednesday failed to pass, but Friday's vote only required a simple majority. Zapatero's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party won the general election, but they fell 7 seats short of an absolute majority in parliament's lower house.\n\nLater, Zapatero announced the members of his new cabinet. Nine of the ministers in his new cabinet are women, and eight of them are men. Carme Chacón, formerly the housing minister, was appointed as Spain's first female defense minister.\n\n\"It is the first government in which a woman has the defence portfolio and the first government in which there are more women than men,\" Zapatero said. \"I feel very proud that there are more women ministers than men.\" María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, who became Spain's first female deputy prime minister in 2004, was reappointed to her position.\n\nTwo new ministries will now be a part of the cabinet. Bibiana Aído was named head of the new Equality Ministry. At 31 years old, she is the youngest minister in Spain's history. Molecular biologist Cristina Garmendia will head the new Science and Innovation Ministry.\n\nZapatero hopes the new cabinet will work to boost the nation's economy, which he says will be one of his top priorities as prime minister. \"We must continue to boost the economy and do it in a new way, less dependent on construction,\" Zapatero said. Miguel Sebastián, Zapatero's former chief economic advisor, was named the new industry minister.\n\nForeign minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos, economy minister Pedro Solbes, interior minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, and justice minister Mariano Fernandez Bermejo all kept their posts, while four other ministers were ousted.",

    "original_text": "The Metropolitan Police's anti-terrorist branch and security service in London have claimed that a terrorist plot to detonate bombs on nine planes travelling mid-air from the United Kingdom to the United States has been thwarted.\n\nThe bombs were to be smuggled onboard in passengers' hand luggage. The planned attacks might have been the biggest terrorist attacks since 9/11, government officials have said. Information gathered after recent arrests in Pakistan convinced British investigators they had to act urgently to stop the plot. The original information about the plan came from the Muslim community in Britain, according to a British intelligence official. The tip resulted from a person who had been concerned about the activities of an acquaintance after the July 7, 2005 terror attacks in London, the official said.\n\nThe counter-terrorism operation took several months to complete. Scotland Yard said twenty-three people are in custody, and were arrested in north and east London, Birmingham and High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. An undercover British agent infiltrated the group, giving the authorities intelligence on the alleged plan, several U.S. government officials said. The men had not bought plane tickets, the officials said, but they were in the process of perusing the Internet to find flights to various cities that had similar departure times. Pakistani officials have said two Britons were arrested last week, and that five Pakistanis have been detained on suspicion of \"facilitating\" the plot. As many as 50 people were involved in the plot, an internal Department of Homeland Security document said.\n\nSpeaking on the day after the arrests, UK Home Secretary John Reid said although officials believed the main suspects were in custody, the UK threat level remained \"critical\", the highest level. He said UK citizens faced a \"common threat\" and appealed for tolerance and resilience. He also added that Britain was grateful for Pakistan's cooperation in breaking up the suspected plot.\n\nAfter the arrests, Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, said: \"We are confident that we have disrupted a plan by terrorists to cause untold death and destruction and to commit, quite frankly, mass murder. We believe that the terrorists' aim was to smuggle explosives on to aeroplanes in hand luggage and to detonate these in flight. We also believe that the intended targets were flights from the United Kingdom to the United States of America. I can confirm that a significant number of people are currently in custody and the operation is ongoing.\" U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, said it was unclear if all suspects were now in custody. U.S. and British officials said some suspects could still be on the loose and that investigations were continuing.\n\nPrime Minister Tony Blair, who is currently holidaying in the Caribbean, paid tribute to the security services and the police. \"I thank them for the great job they are doing in protecting our country. There has been an enormous amount of co-operation with the U.S. authorities which has been of great value and underlines the threat we face and our determination to counter it,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe White House has said the plot had been a direct threat to the U.S., and security officials there say aspects of the plan were suggestive of al-Qaeda. Terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said two factors pointed to the influence of al-Qaeda. He said the organization is \"obsessed\" with commercial aviation, and he added that the timing of the plot was \"very interesting.\" \"It's not clear when this was going to be implemented ... but we are coming up on the fifth anniversary of 9/11. They do want to make a big statement,\" he said.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials said the plotters hoped to stage a dry run by August 10, and the actual attack would have followed days later, the officials told the Associated Press. It is believed that terrorists planned to detonate explosives on three U.S. airliners. A U.S. administration official said the plot targeted Continental Airlines, United, British Airways and American Airlines flights to New York, Washington and California.\n\nA senior U.S. intelligence official suggests that those arrested are British citizens, and some have links with Pakistan. Among those arrested were a Muslim charity worker and a Heathrow Airport employee with an all-area access pass, according to Britain's Channel 4. The suspected terrorists had been under surveillance in Britain since last December, the channel reported. According to ABC News, five more suspects who are still at large in Britain are being \"urgently sought\". At a press conference at the afternoon on August 10, Home Secretary John Reid said the police believe the \"main players\" are accounted for. Two of the suspects left \"martyrdom tapes,\" according to Pakistani sources familiar with the details of the British investigation.\n\nA senior U.S. congressional source said it is believed the plotters planned to mix a British sports drink with a gel-like substance to make an explosive that they would possibly trigger with an MP3 player or cell phone. The sports drink could be combined with a peroxide-based paste to form a potent \"explosive cocktail,\" if properly done, said a U.S. counterterrorism official. \"There are strong reasons to believe the materials in a beverage like that could have been part of the formula,\" the official said. \"What makes it frightening is the sophistication to turn relatively common materials into a dangerous bomb,\" said a U.S. intelligence official.\n\nTwo of the suspects held in connection with the alleged plot to down commercial jetliners with explosives may have had contact with a Pakistani suspected of being an al Qaeda operative, government officials in Britain and the United States said. The officials allege that Matiur Rehman, described as an explosives expert in Pakistan who is now at large, met two of the British suspects in Pakistan. But officials, who say the plot displays signs of al Qaeda participation but are still investigating that angle, do not know whether Rehman was involved in the plot. After the two people returned to Britain, they received a wire transfer of money from Pakistan, the officials said.\n\nMichael Chertoff, the US Secretary of Homeland Security, said the plan was reminiscent of the 1995 plot by 9/11 coordinator Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who envisioned detonating bombs on 11 airlines possibly traveling over the Pacific Ocean. He also said that the plotters were \"getting close to the execution phase\".\n\nThe U.S. is also sending out more air marshals on flights between the UK and the U.S. President Bush said the arrests are a \"stark reminder\" that the U.S. is \"at war with Islamic fascists.\" He thanked British Prime Minister Tony Blair for \"busting this plot.\" U.S. government officials say there were two phone calls made from London to the United States recently by suspects. Those calls were tracked down and investigated, but there is no evidence of any involvement of people in America in the alleged plot.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in New Delhi on August 11 warned American citizens of possible terrorist attacks across India in the week from August 14 to August 20.\n\nMI5, the British internal security service, has raised the threat level to critical, meaning \"an attack is expected imminently and indicates an extremely high level of threat to the UK\".\n\nAs a result, increased security at all British airports have been implemented, leading to delays in departing flights.\nSignificant disruptions include:\n\n* At Heathrow Airport, incoming short-haul flights have resumed. However, long-haul services are still delayed and numerous outbound flights have been cancelled.\n* At Gatwick Airport, all EasyJet flights have been cancelled\n* All flights from Brussels Airport to the UK have been cancelled.\n\nAir passengers across Europe faced a second day of delays on August 11, though the situation had eased from the previous day when London's Heathrow Airport was closed to many incoming flights.\n\nThe alleged plot to smuggle liquid explosives onto planes has led to drastic new security measures at airports around the world.\n\nAll airlines departing from UK airports have told their passengers that they are not permitted to carry any hand baggage on board any aircraft departing from any airport in the UK.\n\nOnly the following items are permitted in the cabin, and must be carried in transparent bags:\n* Wallets and purses, plus their contents.\n* Travel documents, including passports and travel tickets.\n* Prescription medicines, but not in liquid form, unless they can be verified as authentic.\n* Essential medical items, such as a diabetic kit.\n* Glasses and sunglasses, but not in their cases.\n* Contact lens holders, but with no bottles of solution.\n* Baby food and milk, but contents must be tasted by accompanying passenger.\n* Sanitary items for babies.\n* Female sanitary items, unboxed.\n* Handkerchiefs and tissues, unboxed.\n* Keys, but with no electric key fobs.\n\nNo fluids at all are allowed onboard. \"We hope that these measures, which are being kept under review by the government, will need to be in place for a limited period only,\" said a statement issued by the Department for Transport.\n\nWeblog journalists have criticized whether the physical handling of potential explosive liquids reflects the threat authorities claim. In response to CNN reporting, \"Because the plot involved taking liquid explosives aboard planes in carry-ons, passengers at all U.S. and British airports, and those boarding U.S.-bound flights at other international airports, are banned from taking any liquids onto planes.\" XOPL observes, \"And then they have the photo of the TSA guy dumping a tub of confiscated possibly explosive liquids into a garbage can in a crowd of people. ... Nevermind that the plot specifically mentions mixing chemicals and/or nitroglycerin... which explodes if handled too roughly.\" Responding to \"A.J. Leoni, pours the last of her drink into the receptacle while in line for the security checkpoint at the Asheville Regional Airport,\" in the Asheville Citizen-Times, Gabriel Meister writes, \"Pour it into a receptacle? Don't you think that some of these potentially explosive liquids might be more dangerous when, I don't know, mixed in a big vat in the middle of an airport?\"\n\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security said in an email: \"The U.S. threat level is raised to Severe, or Red, for all commercial flights flying from the United Kingdom to the U.S. The U.S. threat level is raised to High, or Orange for all commercial aviation operating in the U.S., including international flights. Flights from the U.S. to the U.K. are also Orange. PROHIBITED ITEMS CHANGE: All liquids and gels are now prohibited at the screening checkpoints. For more information please visit www.tsa.gov.\" Continental, Delta, Northwest and United Airlines advised passengers to arrive three hours before takeoff for domestic and international flights, according to the airlines' Web sites. American Airlines advised passengers to allow for \"extra time.\" Passengers in the U.S. faced a second security check starting August 11.\n\nThe nation's overall terror threat level has not been altered. August 10 2006 was the first time the Department of Homeland Security has raised the threat level for a specific group of flights. British Airways canceled all short haul flights in or out of Heathrow Airport for August 10, 2006, and delays were stacking flights up at airports across Europe.\n\nMassachusetts Governor Mitt Romney ordered the National Guard to Boston's Logan Airport, and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered the National Guard to airports in his state.\n\nThe United States on August 11 renewed its warning to U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Pakistan amid rising concerns over terror activity that would be directed against U.S. interests.\n\nThe Bank of England has notified financial institutions to freeze accounts of 19 people under terrorist financing laws, according to a statement on the Bank's web site. The individuals were identified as Ali Abdula Ahmed, Ali Cossor, ALI Shazad Khuram, Hussain Nabeel, Hussain Tanvir, Hussain Umair, Islam Umar, Kayani Waseem, Khan Assan Abdullah, Khan Waheed Arafat, Khatib Osman Adam, Patel Abdul Muneem, Rauf Tayib, Saddique Muhammed Usman, Sarwar Assad, Savant Ibrahim, Tariq Amin, Asmin, Uddin Shamin Mohammed, and Zaman Waheed.",

    "original_text": "Economy and business\nIn the United Kingdom, the unemployment rate has increased by twenty-seven thousand and has achieved a total of 2.53 million. This figure, which was measured between October 2010 and January 2011, is the highest rate of unemployment the country has experienced since 1994. Department for Work and Pensions\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) stated that the percentage of those jobless was eight per cent, the peak for that rate since 1996. In the three months approaching February 2011, nearly five hundred thousand occupations were vacant, an increase of twenty-four thousand in comparison to the preceding three months.\n\nAccording to the ONS, the quantity of 16-24 year-old individuals without an occupation has increased by 0.8% to a record peak of 20.6%, including students who are seeking employment. British Prime Minister David Cameron described this number as \"disappointing, once again\".\n\nThe executive office also commented that, in February 2011, 10,200 fewer people were requesting Jobseeker's Allowance, causing the total amount to decrease to 1.45 million people. 25,000 more people aged 50–64 now have an occupation, causing the amount of those employed in that age demographic to rise to a record 7.3 million. Cameron has described this situation as a \"very mixed picture\".\n\nAccording to BBC News Online, the average worker's wage was £453 ($729, €521), including bonuses, in January 2011. In comparison to last year, 2.3% of wages were larger in January of this year, which is less than half of the UK's Retail Price Index; it currently stands at 5.1%.\n\nOverall, the total amount of employed individuals has increased by thirty-two thousand and now stands at 29.16 million, the peak value since autumn 2010. 132,000 public sector occupations were eliminated, whereas 428,000 of them have originated within the private sector. \"Clearly any increase in unemployment is unwelcome and a disappointment and it underlines the need for a Budget next week which focuses on growth,\" commented Chris Grayling, the Minister of State of the Department for Work and Pensions, \"on creating an environment where businesses are growing and developing and creating jobs.\"\n\nWithin the four UK countries, thirty-eight thousand more people in England have become unemployed. The unemployment levels in Northern Ireland and Wales have increased by four thousand and two thousand respectively. However, in Scotland, unemployment has decreased by sixteen thousand.",

    "original_text": "Some cancer specialists have stepped up calls for smokers and ex-smokers to undergo advanced screening for lung cancer . They reacted to the recent deaths of Peter Jennings and Barbara Bel Geddes and the disclosure that Dana Reeve has lung cancer by urging people to have their lungs screened with special helical CT chest scans.\n\nBecause health insurance plans do not cover such screening, anxious patients who can afford it are paying about $300 for the test out of pocket. The American Cancer Society discourages using the advanced CT scan technique for screening because doctors do not yet know how to interpret findings of small lesions. A helical scan can show lumps as small as 2 millimetres in diameter, but doctors do not know what to make of such lesions. The tumors may not actually be cancerous, and even small cancers may spontaneously remit or may grow so slowly that surgery, radiation or chemotherapy would do far more harm than good. Preliminary results of a large ongoing study, expected within a year, may provide tentative guidelines on when to perform a biopsy and when CT screening would be worthwhile.\n\nSmoking one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years or more brings a 50 percent chance of dying from lung cancer. For any smoker, 10 years of abstinence cuts the risk in half. Women are more vulnerable than men even if they don't smoke. Environmental pollutants work with smoking to increase risk. People with affected parents or siblings are 2&amp;ndash;3 times more likely to fall ill with lung cancer. A malignant tumor can grow silently for years. In the United States by the time it is recognized a lung cancer has spread in 3 out of 4 patients. Routine chest X-ray screening does not improve survival rate. Although patients treated after their lung cancer has shown up in a highly sensitive helical (also called \"spiral\") CT scan are much more likely to survive, this may only be because small cancers grow very slowly or would cause no trouble even without treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, some cancer experts already strongly support performing the screening. They point out that prompt treatment of lung cancer clearly improves prognosis and that an equivocal scan can be repeated after some months to see if a lesion has enlarged. Furthermore, a decision not to wait for conclusive science but to undergo a helical scan would be supported by consideration of a patient's age, family history, history of smoking and other risk factors. Annual scanning has been recommended for people over age 50 who have smoked 1 pack daily for 30 years or 2 packs for 15 and who also have a known lung condition.",

Venezuela said it will request the extradition of terrorists in Colombia. In Caracas a march was scheduled by thousands of activists supporting the President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez and protesting against the USA. President Chavez appeared on television to accuse the USA of being behind the Colombian accusations. The head of the Colombian Police was traveling in a helicopter when it came under attack by forces of the FARC.\n\nColombia is supported by the USA in opposing the FARC who are believed to be involved in international drug trade. Venezuela is allegedly supported by the Foro de São Paulo as member states, along with Brazil, Cuba and the FARC.\n\nAccording to the Colombian Radio Caracol, La Fiscalía General de la Nación (Attorney General) of Colombia revealed proofs of FARC activities in Venezuela (January 21). The evidence includes the recording of a telephone conversation between two presumed guerrillas, and a list with the names of seven members from FARC and one individual from Ejército de Liberación Nacional (the National Liberation Army, or ELN) who Colombia claims are continuously in Venezuelan territory. ( audio)\n\nThe names of the alleged terrorists, and the crimes Colombia accuses them of, are:\n;From FARC \n:# Aldo Manuel Moscote Fragoso, alias Lucas Iguarán. 4 pending processes by the crimes of rebelín and terrorism.\n:# Emilio del Carmen Ropero Suárez, alias Rubén Zamora. He has 10 pending processes by the crimes of kidnapping extorsivo and terrorism.\n:# Germán Briceño Suárez, alias Gran Noble. 11 pending processes, required by the crimes of homicide, terrorism, extorsivo drug trafficking, kidnapping and empowering of airship.\n:# Jesús Elimio Carvajalino, alias Andrés Paris. 9 pending processes by the crimes of rebellion, terrorism, kidnapping, homicide and traffic of arms.\n:# Luciano Marín Arango, alias Iván Márquez. 133 pending processes. Crimes:kidnapping and extorsion, terrorism, homicide, illicit recruitment.\n:# Luis Edgar Debia Silva, alias Raul Kings. 178 pending processes: violation and violent sexual act, terrorism, rebellion, destruction of protected goods, kidnapping, illicit recruitment, described theft, empowering of airship and drug trafficking.\n:# Seusis Hernández, alias Juan Santrich. It has a pending process by the crimes of concert to break the law, rebellion and illicit recruitment.\n\n;From ELN \n:#Nicolás Rodríguez Bautistas, alias Gabino. 17 pending processes by the crimes of kidnapping and extorsion, forced disappearance, rebellion, theft, homicide and tortures.\n\nThis list was sent to the government of Venezuela.\n\nThe Colombian Caracol Radio also obtained the recording of the telephone call in which, according to the Colombian authorities, alias Juan Santrich, presumed member of the General Staff of the FARC, talks with alias Jorge Tivieras. Both men speak in key on the preparation of a political forum that was carried out in the Venezuelan capital in the first days of December. About a hundred guerrillas were at this event, according to the interpretation of the Colombian authorities. This information would be sent to Ivan Marquez, of the secretaryship of the FARC. In the same conversation it is spoken of the attendance of an indigenous delegation. During the event apparently propaganda would have been distributed and a declaration against president of Colombia Álvaro Uribe was prepared, although the interlocutors do not mention him by name.\n\nThe recording can be heard here.\n\nThe Colombian newspaper El Pais reported in a January 23 news release the helicopters in which the head of the Colombian Police general Jorge Castro and other government officials traveled were attacked by ground forces loyal to the FARC when it flew over a zone of illegal farms in the center-west of the country. No injuries or damage were reported.\n\nAfter officially receiving from Colombia the list of guerrillas from the FARC and the ELN the Government of Venezuela announced by the Venezuelan minister of the Interior, Jesse Chacón that will request to Colombia the capture and extradition of several ex-military and political leaders in Colombia. They are accused of terrorism by Venezuela. Also Chacón announced that his government will study the documentation presented by Colombia.\n\nThe Venezuelan Minister advanced some names in the list he will send: Felipe Rodríguez (retired general of the National Guard) alias \"El Cuervo\" accused of the attack against the consulate of Colombia in Caracas and the industralist Pedro Carmona, who self-proclaimed president of Venezuela after the coup of April of 2002 in Venezuela.\nThe Venezuelan Vice-President José Vicente Rangel said the list of terrorists sent by Colombia to Venezuela was frustrating. According to him the list should be completed with the names of Colombian drug-dealers and paramilitary forces who usually enters Venezuelan territory.\n\nThe president of the Venezuelan National Assembly Mature Nicholas denounced a multimillionaire campaign against Hugo Chávez. He explained the campaign would be being supported by a sector of the Government of the United States from the halting of the guerrilla Rodrigo Granda: \"This campaign has a planning component and execution on the part of the CIA\".\n\n\"They are going to use it in an international show to indicate it like a species of witness who will contribute testimony in against of Venezuela, our democracy to justify and to give veracity to the denunciations that the government (of Alvaro) Uribe has removed from last hour\".\n\nMature added that they had information on a new scandal that will be promoted as of the next week from the testimonies that a person of name \"Sonia\" (protected by USA laws and tied to drug trafficking crimes) will give.\n\nA march of thousands of supporters to President Hugo Chávez was schedulled to January 23 in Caracas, Venezuela. The activivists demand respect to the sovereignty of Venezuela, support the Venezuelan governor in the crisis with Colombia and protest against the USA.\n\nAccording to Venezuelan newspaper El Universal in national chain of radio and television Chávez said that the case of the kidnapping of Rodrigo Granda \"is a new attack of North American imperialism\".\nHe accused the \"imperialistic government of the USA \" \"in a hurry run to defend this upsetting and this vulgarity, in addition to the government of Colombia\". He described the Secretary of State of the USA, Condoleezza Rice, as \"illiterate\" to not know what it is happening in Venezuela. He said that the United States is \"the force more negative than can have for this world\". \n\nThere is some uncertainty about the date of some events. \n\n2004 - December\n* 13: FARC-EP member Rodrigo Granda is arrested by Colombian authorities.\n* 15: The Colombian National Police director Jorge Daniel Castro says Granda was arrested in Cúcuta, Colombia.\n* 16: Sources of the Cúcuta police say Granda was arrested in a city hotel.\n* 17: Another source of the Cúcuta police says Granda was arrested in a street of the Norte de Santander capital, Colombia.\n* 30: The FARC say Granda was kidnapped.\n\n2005 - January\n* 3: The FARC demand Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to begin a investigation.\n* 5: Venezuelan Minister Jesse Chacón says that Venezuela didn't take part in the capture of Granda.\n* 5: The Colombian Minister of Defense Jorge Alberto Uribe says that Colombian forces captured Granda inside Colombian territory.\n* 6: The Colombian President Álvaro Uribe also says that Colombian forces captured Granda inside Colombian territory.\n* 9: The Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says that the Colombian police lies about the Granda capture.\n* 12: The Colombian Minister of Defense Jorge Alberto Uribe says that a reward was paid for Granda. He reiterates that Colombian forces captured Granda inside Colombian territory.\n* 13: The National Police director Jorge Daniel Castro says that Colombian authorities didn't take part of the arrestment of Granda in Caracas, Venezuela.\n* 13: Chavez says that Venezuelan ambassador should leave Bogotá in Colombia.",

Doctors and his family slowly taught him to communicate using tiny movements of his feet and eventually through a specially designed keyboard.\n\nHouben used the keyboard to tell a German newspaper that he 'screamed, but there was nothing to hear' and that when the truth was discovered it was like 'being born again'.\n\nDespite discovering his consciousness in 2006, Houben's case only came to light recently after a study published in the journal BMC Neurology about coma patients used his case as an example.

    "original_text": "NASA's Phoenix spacecraft has landed safely on Mars, following a ten-month flight. Landing occurred yesterday evening at around 23:38 GMT (20:38 EDT), with confirmation being received by flight controllers around fifteen minutes later at 23:53, the communications delay due to the time taken for light and radio signals to travel from Mars back to Earth.\n\nPhoenix was launched atop a Delta II rocket last August. It is the first Mars Scout spacecraft to be sent to explore Mars. It will search for water and complex molecules at the North Pole of Mars. It is the third spacecraft currently operating on Mars, joining the Mars Expedition Rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which are currently operating on the planet's surface. Phoenix is expected to operate on the surface of Mars for 90 Martian days, about 92 Earth days.\n\nScientists monitoring the landing at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California cheered as the news was transmitted by the spacecraft, saying it had landed safely.\n\nAccording to the live broadcast on NASA TV, a systems check began in final preparation for landing at 22:20 GMT (7:20 p.m. eastern time) which was given the \"all green\". At 22:22, Phoenix was confirmed to be properly aligned for entry into the Martian atmosphere. At 22:30 Phoenix began to accelerate into the atmosphere, where it will hurtle towards the planet at nearly 11,000 miles an hour. At 22:41 the data stream was successfully sent to Earth, Phoenix successfully separated from its boosters and sent a UHF signal to NASA. At 22:44 its main radio was confirmed to be on.\n\nScientists monitoring the MRO then confirmed the signal from Phoenix at 22:45. Approximately 3 minutes later Phoenix was confirmed to have entered the Martian atmosphere.\n\nAccording to predictions before the landing - based on the sequence of events programmed into onboard computers - the cruise stage, which had controlled the spacecraft during its journey from Earth to Mars, separated from the probe which was to enter the atmosphere at 23:24:15 GMT. Entry interface occurred at 23:31:15, and the parachute deployed at 23:34:58. The heat shield was jettisoned at 23:35:13, followed by the rest of the \"aeroshell\", which had protected the spacecraft during decent, and the parachute, at 23:37:13. Landing itself occurred at 23:38:36 GMT.\n\nDuring descent, the spacecraft's progress was monitored by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft, already in Areocentric orbit. Mars Odyssey was in contact with Phoenix throughout the descent, including during the phase of the descent where maximum temperatures were reached, when controllers had predicted that data would be lost. The HiRISE camera on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to photograph Phoenix under its parachute during descent.\n\nPhoenix's goal is to gather environmental information about Mars to search for possible locations for the best signs of microbial life in the soil. It will also research the history of water on Mars. The mission is scheduled to last for at least 92 Earth days, or 90 Martian days.\n\nThe spacecraft landed in an area near the North Pole of Mars, unofficially named the Green Valley. It is an area about 250 kilometres wide, located in the Vastitas Borealis plains.\n\nPhoenix is carrying a number of instruments to investigate Mars. Some of these were taken from the cancelled 2001 Mars Surveyor lander, and some others were derived from instruments flown on the Mars Polar Lander (MPL) spacecraft. MPL was launched in January 1999, but failed during its descent to the Martian surface. Landing on Mars is considered to be one of the most difficult challenges in space exploration, and one scientist working on today's landing said that \"this is not a trip to Grandma's for the weekend\". More than half of previous missions to Mars have failed, leading to jokes that exploration of the planet is cursed.\n\nThis is the 38th spacecraft to be launched to Mars, and the 19th to arrive successfully, bringing the success rate to exactly 50 percent. It is also the 12th spacecraft to attempt a landing on Mars, and the 7th to successfully accomplish this.\n\nUpon confirmation of landing, a flight controller was heard to exclaim \"The Phoenix has landed, welcome to Vastitas Borealis!\", whilst others cheered, and congratulated each other on the successful landing.",

    "original_text": "United Kingdom\n\nThe United Kingdom electorate took to the polls yesterday to vote in both local elections and a UK-wide referendum regarding the system used to elect its members of parliament to the House of Commons. The polls opened at 07:00 BST (0600 UTC) yesterday morning and closed at 22:00 BST (2100 UTC) last night.\n\nAlongside the normal local elections for seats on 279 councils, and elections for seats in the devolved Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Irish Assemblies, the country saw the first nation-wide referendum since 1975, regarding potentially replacing the current first past the post voting system with the Alternative Vote (AV) system currently used for general elections in Australia, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea, as well as for some mayoral and party leadership elections worldwide, including in the UK.\n\nMayoral elections also took place in Leicester, Mansfield, Beford, Middlesbrough, and Torbay. Some areas also experienced elections to parish councils, while the constituency of Leicester South underwent a by-election after its Labour MP Sir Peter Soulsby stood down to run for mayor.\nAt present, the UK uses the ‘first past the post’ system to elect MPs to the House of Commons. Should the ‘alternative vote’ system be used instead?\nOne polling station in Stockport was delivered the wrong ballot papers, causing around 90 people to cast invalid votes. Those affected were, where possible, contacted and asked to cast their vote again, according to the local council. Another, in Llandeilo, was closed for two hours after escaped dogs bit four people nearby.\n\nThe AV referendum came about as a result of the coalition agreement between the Liberal Democrats, who support voting reform and promised a referendum in their campaign, and the Conservatives, who initially opposed reform but agreed to a referendum as a compromise, following the election in May last year.\n\nThe Scottish National Party (SNP) hopes to retain control of the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, where it currently runs the minority government, in the hopes of potentially holding a referendum regarding Scottish independence, which they did not deliver in their first term in power; meanwhile Labour hope to end their coalition with Plaid Cymru by taking control of the Welsh Assembly; however, sources from within the party report that it is likely that Labour will fail to reach a majority. Little is expected to change in Ireland, where the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin are expected to retain their dominance over the Northern Irish Assembly.\n\nPolls taken prior to the election implied that AV would be rejected by some margin, but due to low turnout — despite good weather — the results are likely to be unpredictable. The results of the AV referendum are not due to be declared until 20:00 BST (1900 UTC) today, and counting is not due to begin until 16:00 BST (1500 UTC).\n\nAs usual, Sunderland was the first council to report, and was held by Labour; as is the case with many councils in the north of England, it is considered a Labour safe seat. Early predictions indicate that a number of Liberal Democrat councilors in northern cities will lose their seats to Labour or Conservative candidates. Former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett reportedly said that the national opinion had changed from \"Clegg mania\" into \"Clegg pneumonia\". In an interview with the BBC, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg put predicted Liberal Democrat losses down to voters being \"angry\" at the coalition government, but also said that the electorate is \"not stupid\", and would vote in council elections based on local—rather than national—factors.\n\nThe first Scottish Parliament constituency to report was Rutherglen, which is held by the incumbent Labour MP, James Kelly. Despite being considered Labour's fourth safest Scottish seat, it experienced a swing of more than seven percent towards the SNP, and large Labour losses are predicted across Scotland. Nearby East Kilbride was the second to report, and was gained by SNP candidate Linda Fabiani from the Labour incumbent Andy Kerr.",

    "original_text": "Politics and conflicts\nAl-Qaeda has said it will continue to launch more terrorist attacks on the U.S. and warned the death of their leader Osama bin Laden, would \"not be wasted\". The statement from the organization, posted on jihadist internet forums, came as the Pentagon released videos filmed inside the terrorist leader's compound which was raided last weekend. Intelligence officials said at a briefing in Washington, D.C. that the videos showed that bin Laden was still playing an active role in al-Qaeda plotting.\n\nAlthough the video tapes have no audio, they show bin Laden watching news coverage of himself on television and preparing to record a propaganda film. The tapes are the latest intelligence to emerge from computer equipment seized from bin Laden's compound during the raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan by U.S. special forces last weekend. Earlier this week it emerged bin Laden had been planning an attack on the American rail network on the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks this year. U.S. officials yesterday stressed that the al-Qaeda plot was only \"aspirational\", but involved derailing multiple trains by damaging rail lines at various sites.\n\nsource=al-Qaeda statement on Osama bin Laden's death\nTonight one intelligence official said the information gleaned from the computers was the \"single largest collection of senior terrorist materials ever.\" The computer equipment also revealed that there were hopes of attacking major transportation hubs, and that during the six years he lived at the compound in Pakistan, bin Laden stayed in close contact with senior affiliates and played an active role in developing terrorist plots. An unnamed U.S. official told The New York Times that bin Laden \"wasn't just a figurehead,\" but \"continued to plot and plan, to come up with ideas about targets and to communicate those ideas to other senior al-Qaeda leaders.\"\n\nConfirming the death of bin Laden in a statement this week, al-Qaeda said his killing would be a \"curse\" on the U.S. and its allies. \"Their happiness will turn into sorrow, and their blood will be mixed with their tears. We call upon our Muslim people in Pakistan, on whose land Sheikh Osama was killed, to rise up and revolt.\" The revelation that al-Qaeda was planning more attacks against the U.S. comes only several days after officials warned the terrorist group was likely to be plotting a revenge attack to avenge the death of bin Laden.\n\nFour days after the raid on the compound, U.S. president Barack Obama visited Ground Zero in New York on Thursday to pay tribute to the 3,000 people killed in the September 11 attacks, for which al-Qaeda was found responsible. Bin Laden is believed to have masterminded the attacks on the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. \"When we say we will never forget, we mean what we say,\" Obama told firefighters in the city. He laid a wreath made from red, white and blue flowers after meeting with relatives of the victims of the attacks. \"We are going to make sure that the perpetrators of that horrible act will see justice,\" he said. After the wreath was laid, he stood with his head bowed for a moment of silence.\n\nsource=Barack Obama\nThe news of bin Laden's death after a team of U.S. Navy Seals descended into the compound was greeted with celebrations across the U.S. on Sunday night, but concerns have been raised as to whether the killing was lawful after the terrorist leader's daughter told Pakistani authorities that he had been captured and then killed. But Attorney General Eric Holder contradicted the statement, saying: \"If he had surrendered, attempted to surrender, I think we should obviously have accepted that, but there was no indication that he wanted to do that and therefore his killing was appropriate.\"\n\nObama's visit came a day after he announced he would not be releasing images of bin Laden's body. In an interview to be aired on CBS News, the president said: \"It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence, as a propaganda tool.\" The images&amp;mdash;described as \"very gruesome\"&amp;mdash;are reported to show bin Laden shot above the left eye, with parts of his brain exposed.\n\nAs Obama travelled to New York, the growing rift between the relations of the U.S. and Pakistan was continuing to grow after officials in Islamabad said the U.S. president may have breached U.N. rules by ordering the raid, because Pakistan was not told in advance. Senior officials within the Pakistani army also ordered the number of American military personnel in the country to be cut to \"minimum essential\" levels. Salman Bashir, the Pakistani foreign secretary, strained relations further at a press conference when he said there were serious concerns that the U.S. had breached U.N. resolutions on sovereignty, and said Pakistan is determined to \"uphold our sovereignty and safeguard our security\". Pakistani army officials risked tautening relations between the two countries again on Thursday as they announced they would consider cutting ties with Washington, D.C. if the U.S. mounted another unannounced raid on their soil, and said they would be expelling U.S. military personnel in retaliation.\n\nThe conflict stems from the raid during the weekend on the Abbottabad compound. Pakistan says it was not informed about the raid, which involved U.S. helicopters flying into Pakistani airspace to drop commandos who raided the house. The rift has grown further after U.S. officials questioned how Pakistani intelligence allowed bin Laden to live in the compound, a short distance from a military training academy, and suggested the terrorist leader may have been harbored by the government. The director of the CIA said earlier this week that Pakistan was not informed about the raid because of fears he was being harbored by Pakistani officials who might warn him about the raid. The president of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, dismissed \"baseless speculation\" that his administration was sheltering bin Laden.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insisted tension between Washington and Pakistan over the raid had been exaggerated, and said she was keen to keep relations with Islamabad. \"It is not always an easy relationship. You know that,\" she said. \"But, on the other hand, it is a productive one for both our countries and we are going to continue to cooperate between our governments, our militaries, our law-enforcement agencies, but most importantly between the American and Pakistani people.\"",

The Brotherhood announced Tuesday it will apply for political party status, but will not field a candidate for president in elections to replace former President Hosni Mubarak as that might be divisive. \"It's time for solidarity, it's time for unity, in my opinion we need a national consensus\", said a Brotherhood senior leader, Essam el-Arian.\n\nAmr El-Chobaki, of Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, remarked about the appointment of a Brotherhood member to the committee, \"I could have been concerned if there were no other political currents represented in the committee, which is not the case ...

    "original_text": "Turkish and Moroccan authorities arrested two suspects who are believed to be the creators of the Zotob worm that took down CNN’s computer network and crippled other computers in the U.S. and worldwide earlier this month.\n\nThe FBI traced an electronic trail that led to two men from the Middle East and North Africa. An 18-year old Moroccan, Farid Essebar, is believed to have written the worm in return for a payment from a 21-year old Turk Atilla Ekici. Both were arrested Friday and await prosecution in their respective countries.\n\nIt appears that Essebar and Ekici never met personally, and conducted the entire cyber crime through contact with each other over the internet. The online monikers for the two is believed to be \"Diabl0\" for Essebar and “Coder” for Ekici.\n\nThe speedy pace at which investigators made arrests is credited from working closely with the Microsoft Corp., and Moroccan and Turkish authorities, said the FBI assistant director Louis Reigel. \"Had we not had those entities involved in this investigation, I suspect it would still be ongoing today.\"\n\nMicrosoft investigators began in March to analyze an e-mail variant called Mytob, which emerged in late February. The two suspects are believed to have authored the predecessor to Mytob, known then as 'Rbot'. These worms could plant in infected computers a backdoor that could be used to gain remote access to the computer and their networks at a later date.\n\nThe release of the Zytob worm yielded more evidence of the perpetrators’ identities. The motive for the attacks appears to be financial gain and not terrorist related. The two men allegedly forwarded stolen financial information to a credit-card fraud ring, according to the Moroccan government.\n\nThe 5-year-old Windows 2000 operating system is most vulnerable to attack. The worm uses a flaw in the Windows Plug and Play service; a flaw for which Microsoft has issued a patch. But an August 23 Microsoft advisory notes that some non-default configurations of Windows XP Service Pack 1 systems could also be at risk. XP SP2 users are not at risk.",

Consent of the Governor-General was required and there is no right of appeal.\n\nRayed Abdullah, a United States-qualified pilot, arrived in New Zealand in February under a variation of his name.\n\nImmigration Minister David Cunliffe says “The government considered that the man's continued presence in New Zealand posed a threat to national security because he was directly associated with persons responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001,\"\n\n\"We don't have any specific information that he was a terrorist. We know that he was associated with terrorists,\" he said, adding that his \"activities in New Zealand\" warranted the deportation. Once his real identity became known, he was identified as having close connections to people involved with the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, and had been named in the 9/11 Commission Report,\"\n\n\"Initially, he lived in Auckland where he undertook some English language training, the stated purpose of his visit. He then shifted to Palmerston North where he was building up his flying hours flying with an instructor – he'd previously trained as a pilot in the United States.\"\n\n\"With immigration officials, police arrested the man in Palmerston North on Monday, 29 May, and he was deported to Saudi Arabia the next day.\"\n\n\"For security reasons, I cannot comment further. I am advised; however, that at no point was there any specific risk to New Zealanders during the man's time in this country.\"\n\nThe US Government's 9/11 Commission Report says that Abdullah lived and trained in Phoenix, Arizona with Hani Hanjour, the Saudi Arabian believed to have piloted Flight 77 into the Pentagon. Abdullah was a leader at the Islamic Cultural Centre in Phoenix where, the FBI says, he \"reportedly gave extremist speeches at the mosque\".\n\nThe report also said another associate of Hanjour, Faisal al Salmi, had flight training with Rayed Abdullah but wanted to keep his training secret.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation said al-Salmi was deceptive when he was asked if he had taken flight training at the behest of an organisation.\n\nSection 72 of the Immigration Act 1987 provides that where the Immigration Minister certifies that the continued presence in New Zealand of a person constitutes a threat to national security, the Governor-General may, by order in council, order that person's deportation.",

Tsunami warnings have been issued for parts of Australia as well.\n\nAccording to the US Geological Survey, the magnitude 8.0 quake struck Sunday, April 1, 2007 at 20:39:56 (UTC) about 45 km (25 mi) south-southeast of Gizo, New Georgia Islands, Solomon Islands, at a depth of 10 km.\n\nThe tsunami was reported as several yards, possibly ten feet, high on the western side of the Solomon Islands and has destroyed at least two villages, leaving at least four people missing and fifteen dead. At least six of those who died were children. The town of Munda reports heavy damage from the tsunami.\n\n\"Two villages were reported to have been completely inundated. We have received reports of four people missing,\" said Solomon Islands National Disaster Management official, Julian McLeod who also said that communication is difficult because most communication lines are under water.\n\nThe government of the Solomon Islands reported in a press release, April 2, two confirmed deaths and several others missing in Sasamunga village in South Choiseul. The press release described 10 meters high waves that pushed 500 meters inland. The hospital in Sasamunga village was destroyed by the waves. In addition, nearby villages reported damage to health centres and schools. The premier of Choiseul, Jackson Kiloe, declared his province \"in disaster\" and called on the Solomon government disaster authorities to contact the province.\n\nTsunami warnings had been issued for Queensland Australia's Barrier Reef Islands and Willis Island in the Coral Sea, as well as South Pacific states. The earthquake was centred 2145 km North-northeast of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\n\nAustralia's National Meteorological and Oceanographic Centre in Melbourne warned that a possible tsunami could affect Willis Island at 8.30 a.m. (AEST) and Cooktown about 9.30 a.m. (AEST). The Centre later extended the tsunami warning to Norfolk Island, Lord Howe Island and the whole eastern coast down to Tasmania. People were warned to exit the water and move away from low lying coastal areas. Afterward, at 11:30 am, all fears of the tsunami were put to rest as the Willis Islands reported no tsunami. All warnings for Eastern Australian coasts have been cleared, with no imminent threat perceived.\n\nJapan's Meteorological Agency is determining whether the Japanese archipelago is at risk of a tsunami, reported the Kyodo news agency.\n\nAccording to the NOAA/NWS West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Centre, a tsunami has been observed at the following sites:\n\n; Honiara, Solomon Island : (9.4S, 159.9E) 0.215m (0.7ft) at 22:52 UTC\n; Port Vila Vanuatu : (17.8S, 168.3E) 0.12m (0.4ft) at 23:27 UTC\n\nThe tsunami amplitudes are measured relative to normal sea level, not crest-to-trough heights. Forecast models indicate the tsunami energy will be mainly contained to the south of the Solomon Islands. A bulletin from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC), dated April 2, 2007 01:17 UTC, provided further information. \"Sea level readings indicate a tsunami was generated. It may have been destructive along coasts near the earthquake epicentre and could also be a threat to more distant coasts. Authorities should take appropriate action in response to this possibility.\"\n\nIn addition, the PTWC suggested that \"when no major waves are observed for two hours after the estimated time of arrival or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours then local authorities can assume the threat is passed. Danger to boats and coastal structures can continue for several hours due to rapid currents. As local conditions can cause a wide variation in tsunami wave action the all clear determination must be made by local authorities.\"",

The Supreme Court is not required to hear oral arguments and it is possible they could refuse to hear the case.\n\nA spokesperson for the Franken campaign says that Coleman is up to the \"same old, same old.\"\n\n\"Sometimes you come up on the short end of a close and bitter election. But at some point, you have to accept the reality for what it is,\" said Marc Elias, one of Franken's lawyers.\n\nThe Coleman campaign argues that 4,400 ballots from Coleman-leaning districts have improperly not been counted, while some undetermined number of ballots (perhaps contributing up to 100 of Franken's 312-vote margin) were accidentally double-counted. Coleman also argues that 132 ballots from the Dinkytown neighborhood of Minneapolis should not have been counted, since the envelope containing them was lost or stolen after the machine count and before the recount. The Franken campaign, meanwhile, supports the previous three-judge panel (from a Democrat, a Republican, and an Independent) unanimous ruling giving Franken victory.\n\nThe Franken campaign, anticipating a final victory and certification by the Minnesota Secretary of State, has begun hiring a staff for Franken's senatorial office. Franken's spokespeople say he is going to start by hiring Alana Peterson, a former state director for Representative Jim Oberstar, as state director.",

He linked them to an explosion on the 31st in a Moscow hotel, in which a bomber died after the device he was building went off prematurely.\n\nPrime Minister Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that the attack is not thought to be linked to Chechnyan insurgency.

The head of Pakistan's team investigating the assassination, Abdul Majeed, read the findings of the British pathologist who assisted with the investigation.\n\n\"The blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle causing a severe and fatal head injury,\" Majeed said.\n\nTelevision footage of the attack shows a single gunman firing shots toward Ms. Bhutto seconds before the explosion. Investigators determined the person firing the gun was also the suicide bomber.\n\n\"All the evidence indicates that one suspect has fired the shot before detonating an improvised explosive device,\" Majeed said. \"At the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of Mrs. Bhutto's vehicle.\"\n\nPakistan President Pervez Musharraf invited Scotland Yard to investigate the cause of Ms. Bhutto's death after some of her supporters charged that the government could be involved in the attack and was covering up circumstances of her assassination.\n\nOfficials of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party maintain she was shot during the attack. Even after the results of the Scotland Yard investigation were released, party spokeswoman Sherry Rehman insists that an assassin's bullet hit the former prime minister.\n\n\"We clearly saw even on footage that she recoiled from a bullet and she fell inside,\" Rehman said. \"The issue really is that this gives us all the more reason to ask for a larger U.N. investigation into what led up to the events of December 27 and to what is behind the hand that pulled the trigger and to who are the financiers, sponsors, organizers and perpetrators of this crime.\"\n\nThe Scotland Yard report notes that despite the lack of a detailed search of the crime scene or an autopsy of Ms. Bhutto's body, sufficient evidence is available for investigators to draw what they are calling reliable conclusions.\n\nDetectives relied on X-rays of Ms. Bhutto's head and a detailed examination of video footage of the attack. The British team only investigated how Ms. Bhutto was killed, not who was behind it.\n\nThe Pakistani government says an al-Qaida-linked militant chief based on the border with Afghanistan is responsible for her killing.\n\nAt least four people have been arrested in connection with the case, including a 15-year-old boy who told police he was among a five-man suicide squad charged with assassinating the opposition leader.\n\nMs. Bhutto's death led to widespread rioting and protests and forced a delay of nationwide elections currently scheduled for later this month.",

    "original_text": "Vassar Clements, age 77, a legendary fiddle player who took bluegrass music from an obscure cultural art form to a mainstream influence, and who played on over 2000 albums, passed away at his Goodlettsville, Tennessee home August 16th 2005 at 8:35 am Nashville time (CST) from lung cancer which had metastasized to his liver and brain.\n\nMr. Clements taught himself to play the fiddle at age 7, and though he had no formal training was recognized as one of the world's most versatile fiddle players and was considered a virtuoso. The first song he learned was \"There's an Old Spinning Wheel in the Parlor\". He described his talent saying, \"It was God's gift, something born in me. I was too dumb to learn it any other way. I listened to the (Grand Ole) Opry some. I'd pick it up one note at a time. I was young, with plenty of time and I didn't give up. You'd come home from school, do your lessons and that's it. No other distractions. I don't read music. I play what I hear.\"\n\nHe didn't always earn his living playing music, though. In the mid-1960s he was employed briefly at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where he worked on plumbing. He also performed several other blue-collar jobs including work in a Georgia paper mill, as switchman for Atlantic Coast Railroad; he even sold insurance and once owned a potato chip franchise.\n\nIn his 50 year career he played with artists ranging from Woody Herman, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band to The Grateful Dead, Linda Ronstadt and Paul McCartney, and earned at least five Grammy nominations and numerous professional accolades. He once recorded with the pop group the Monkees by happenstance, when he stayed behind after an earlier recording session. He also appeared in Robert Altman's 1975 film \"Nashville\".\n\nHis 2005 Grammy award for best country instrumental performance was for \"Earl's Breakdown,\" by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and featured Mr. Clements, Earl Scruggs, Randy Scruggs and Jerry Douglas.\n\nMr. Clements, whose last performance was February 4 in Jamestown, N.Y., was hospitalized earlier this year for 18 days to receive chemotherapy and other treatment. He had been diagnosed in March 2005.\n\nBorn in Kinard, South Carolina, his musical career began at age 14 when he associated with Bill Monroe, and later officially joined the Blue Grass Boys band where he remained for seven years. In 1957 he joined bluegrass band Jim &amp; Jesse McReynolds where he remained until 1962. In 1967 he returned to Nashville where he became a much sought after studio musician.\n\nAfter a brief touring stint with Faron Young he joined John Hartford's Dobrolic Plectral Society in 1971 when he met guitarist Norman Blake and Dobro player Tut Taylor, and recorded Aereo Plain, a widely acclaimed newgrass album that helped broaden the bluegrass market and sound. After less than a year he joined Earl Scruggs, who first earned widespread renown for playing the theme to sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nHis 1972 work with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on their album Will the Circle Be Unbroken earned him even wider acclaim, and later worked with the Grateful Dead's Wake of the Flood and Jimmy Buffett's A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean.\n\nThough he played numerous instruments, Mr. Clements indicated that he chose the fiddle over guitar recalling that, \"I picked up a guitar and fiddle and tried them both out. The guitar was pretty easy, but I couldn't get nothing out of the fiddle. So every time I'd see those instruments sitting side by side, I'd grab that fiddle.\"\n\nBig band and swing music were considerable influences upon his style and musical development, and he said that, “Bands like Glenn Miller, Les Brown, Tommy Dorsey, Harry James and Artie Shaw were very popular when I was a kid. I always loved rhythm, so I guess in the back of my mind the swing and jazz subconsciously comes out when I play, because when I was learning I was always trying to emulate the big-band sounds I heard on my fiddle.”\n\nHis last album 'Livin' With the Blues', released in 2004, featured guest appearances by Elvin Bishop, Norton Buffalo, Maria Muldaur and others.\n\nMr. Clements' daughter Midge Cranor wrote on his website that \"As I was still holding his hand his breathing stopped. I looked at the clock and it was 7:20 am.\"\n\nMr. Clements' remains have been transported to Bond Memorial Chapel, 1098 Weston Drive, Mt. Juliet, TN 37122; (615) 773-2663.",

    "original_text": "__NOTOC__\nThe United Kingdom Crown Prosecution Service has announced that it has sufficient evidence that a former FSB (formerly KGB) officer should be charged with the murder last year of Alexander Litvinenko.\n\nAndrei Lugovoi is charged with the murder of Mr Litvinenko, by the administration of the highly radioactive Polonium-210 in a hotel in Mayfair, London, on 1st November 2006. Mr Litvinenko, 43, died of radiation sickness in University College Hospital on 23rd November. The case received considerable publicity at the time, with pictures of Litvinenko in hospital and showing the effects of the radiation poisoning.\n\nLitvinenko was himself a former Russian FSB agent and was a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He had tried to publish a book in Russia describing Putin's rise to power as having been organised by the KGB. He was forced to flee from Russia and had lived for some time in London, being granted British citizenship in October 2006.\n\nHe continued his dissent throughout the remainder of his life, culminating in a posthumous statement published on 24th November 2006 alleging that Putin was responsible for his death.\n\n4=Sir Ken Macdonald, CPS\n\nLitvinenko's murder led to a lengthy investigation by the Metropolitan Police Service and additional specialist police forces following a trail of sites which had been contaminated with radiation, leading eventually to Moscow. A file of evidence was sent in January 2007 to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration as to whether any criminal charges might be brought.\n\nThe Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Ken Macdonald, QC, in announcing the decision to prosecute, said: \"Prosecutors from CPS Counter Terrorism Division have carefully considered the material contained in that police file. They have also asked the police to carry out further inquiries, which are now complete. And, finally, they have consulted with me.\"\n\n\"I have today concluded that the evidence sent to us by the police is sufficient to charge Andrey Lugovoy with the murder of Mr Litvinenko by deliberate poisoning. I have further concluded that a prosecution of this case would clearly be in the public interest.\"\n\n\"In those circumstances, I have instructed CPS lawyers to take immediate steps to seek the early extradition of Andrey Lugovoy from Russia to the United Kingdom, so that he may be charged with murder - and be brought swiftly before a court in London to be prosecuted for this extraordinarily grave crime.\"\n\nThe announcement followed the summoning of the Russian Ambassador to London to the Foreign Office to be told by Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett that she expected that the Russian authorities would co-operate fully with Britain to arrange the extradition of Mr Lugovoi to stand trial in London. However there are indications from Moscow that the extradition of Lugovoi, who denies any involvement in the murder, is unlikely to happen. Marina Gridneva, spokeswoman for the Russian Prosecutor General's Office said that \"under Russian law, a citizen of the Russian Federation cannot be handed over to a foreign country\".\n\nThere is no bilateral extradition treaty between Russia and the UK. Legislation passed by Russia to deal with individual requests from countries in Europe rules out the extradition of its citizens, even to the extent that when in 1966 it became a signatory to the European convention on extradition, it granted itself an exemption from such a course.\n\nHowever it has been reported that such a ban on extradition would not necessarily prevent Lugovoi being tried in Russia using evidence from the UK.",

The path to ratification began on September 11, 2003 with 11 major drafts of the specification over the course of six years. Even though just approved, wireless devices have been available on the the market for over two years, running on what is known as \"draft n\" or \"pre-N\".\n\nThe 802.11n standard operates on both the 2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz frequencies. This will allow it to be backwards compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has dual radios. The speeds of 802.11n are substantially faster than that of its predecessors with a maximum theoretical throughput of 600Mbit/s.\n\nVery few additions were made to the 802.11n draft standard over the last two years, so most if not all \"draft n\" hardware available on the market today is expected to be compatible with n-standard devices available in the future.

Reports state that 5 people have been killed, and over 300 injured. The injured were police and protesters alike, suffering from smoke poisoning, rubber bullets, and stoning. Among the injured was a Japanese citizen, who was reportedly flown to Japan in the morning.\n\nPeaceful protests began on Monday evening, however, they were dispersed in the night. The protests on Tuesday began peacefully on Sukhbaatar Square, however as they moved toward the headquarters of ruling party Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, they were joined by many more people, who began attacking the building with stones, knocking out the windows.\n\nRiot police were deployed, and as the protests escalated with protesters setting the building on fire with alcoholic beverages and petrol, they reacted with tear gas and rubber bullets. As the Party Headquarters was almost completely set ablaze, the protesters began looting the vicinity, with reports of bank robberies. A wooden extension to the nearby Culture Palace, also known as the Art Gallery, also caught fire, with many priceless artifacts either looted or damaged by fire and water. As the police and army were deployed, about 700 protesters were detained.\n\nIn the aftermath, a four-day state of emergency was declared in Ulaanbaatar by President Nambaryn Enkhbayar. Measures include:\n*All protests or demonstrations are banned\n*The city center will be sealed off, with a curfew between 10pm and 8am\n*All TV channels and radios except the Mongolian National Broadcaster will be temporarily shut down.\n*No alcohol will be sold or consumed.\n*Use of weapons or any object capable of causing bodily harm will be banned.\n\nPreliminary election results indicated that the MPRP had a clear majority in parliament.\n\nPolice chief said on the state TV that the situation is now under control, but it should be necessary to leave armored vehicles and the troops on their current positions in the capital. An emergency session of parliament also began at around 18:00 Local Time (July 2), however the session was closed to the media by vote, with the basis of high levels of tension erupting in case of disagreements during the session.\n\nAll TV channels have been cut off except for the Mongolian National Broadcaster. However some, like Eagle TV, and other internet-based news sites have been reporting on the Internet. A video on their site shows interviews with citizens claiming that their relatives have been detained while coming home from work, although having no part in the protests. The interviewees also allege that the investigators are brutally detaining them. The Government has made no reports about this.\n\nThe four days of emergency rule will be the first in the history of Mongolia.",

Under the new system, patients will be able to receive their Medicare rebates electronically without having to visit a Medicare office.\n\nDuring an interview in Sydney today, Prime Minister John Howard, along with his human services minister Joe Hockey and health minister Tony Abbott, announced that patients who pay for the services of a doctor using their credit cards will be able to receive their rebates electronically within 24 hours. Under the current system patients must visit a Medicare office to receive their rebates.\n\nJohn Howard said the 80,000 people per day who queue at Medicare offices will no longer need to spend their lunch break in line at Medicare.\n\nAccording to the government, doctors who bulk-bill their patients through Medicare will benefit through faster payments and reduced paperwork. \"If it’s a bulk bill transaction; all they do is hand over their Medicare card,\" said Mr Hockey.\n\n\"The Medicare card is swiped in the EFTPOS device, all is done.\"\n\n\"Doctors will be rebated within 24 hours.\"\n\n\"Currently doctors are rebated up to 14 days for bulk bill claims.\"\n\nThe government claims that electronic rebates will be less expensive to process&amp;mdash;costing only a few cents, compared to an estimated AUD $3.50 for an over-the-counter transaction. Despite this, patients who still wish to visit a Medicare office to receive their rebates will still be able to do so.\n\nThe minister for human services was quick to assure Australians that Medicare offices would remain open saying that over the past twelve months they have taken on an \"expanded role\" with the Family Assistance Office's services being provided in Medicare offices.",

The parliamentary election is for both the House of Assembly and the Senate. In the presidential election, Voice of America has reported that analysts in Zimbabwe have predicted a victory for incumbent Robert Mugabe.\n\nWith the last parliamentary election having been held in 2005, the subsequent election was initially planned to be held in 2010, but after an abortive plan to delay the 2008 presidential election to 2010, it was decided to instead bring the parliamentary election forward by two years so that it could be held concurrently with the 2008 presidential election.\n\nThe House of Assembly is being expanded from 150 to 210 members, all elected, in the 2008 election, while the Senate is being expanded to 93 seats, 60 of which will be directly elected (six from each province). There are 29 constituencies in Harare, 28 in Midlands, 26 in Manicaland, 18 in Mashonaland Central, 23 in Mashonaland East, 22 in Mashonaland West, 26 in Masvingo, 13 in Matabeleland North, and 13 in Matabeleland South, and 12 in Bulawayo. Unlike in past elections, when constituency voter rolls were used, ward voter rolls will be used in the 2008 election. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission delimited 1,958 wards.\n\nOn January 25, 2008, the specific date of the election was announced as March 29. A spokesperson for the faction of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) led by Morgan Tsvangirai denounced this as \"an act of madness and arrogance\", while the leader of the other MDC faction, Arthur Mutambara, said that a free and fair election could not be held under the existing conditions, calling for a new constitution to be adopted prior to the election.\n\nPrior to the election being held, ZANU-PF has already won two seats where it was unopposed: the House of Assembly seat from Muzarabani South, won by Edward Raradza, and the Senate seat from Rushinga, won by Damien Mumvuri.\n\nWhile not inviting any observers from the European Union or the United States, Zimbabwe has invited 47 observer teams, including observers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union, China, Russia, and Iran. On March 11, the arrival of the first 50 observers from SADC was reported, with more expected. SADC had already conducted a preliminary mission in February, in which its team looked at constituencies, their boundaries, and the number of candidates, and used that information to determine the number of observers that would be necessary.\n\nThere are about 5.6 million registered voters and there will be about 11,000 polling stations, compared to about 4,000 polling stations in the 2005 parliamentary election.",

The charge related to lost and found cash that a member of the public had handed in to the police after discovering it on a bridle path.\n\nYeats was on duty in Hastings on July 19 this year when Lewes Police Station was given the plastic bag of money, totalling £3,500 in £20 notes. He used a police computer to read about the find on an incident database and rang his own force three times using the name \"Kirk Rose\". He told officers he was from Cornwall and his wife had lost around £3,000 in the area the previous day.\n\nPolice launched an investigation into the veracity of these claims as they felt the condition of the money was so poor that it been left in the open for much longer. The calls were traced to Yeats's police-issued mobile. He was found to have researched the location of the loss and created a false address for himself.\n\nYeats, who resigned from the police after being arrested, was charged under the Fraud Act 2006. Brighton Magistrates' Court decided its sentencing powers were insufficient to mark the gravity of the offence and so remanded him in custody to be sentenced at a later date by a judge at Lewes Crown Court.

    "original_text": "Crime and law\nOn Friday, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) expanded its long-standing definition of rape to include men, and the rape of any gender by lack of consent &amp;mdash; as opposed to physical coercion. The revised definition should ensure all rapes are recorded in crime statistics. Valerie Jarrett, a White House adviser, said it was a \"very, very important step.\"\n\nThe new definition defines rape as: \"The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\"\n\nDescribing the changes to crime reporting as \"long overdue\", United States Attorney General Eric Holder said the revised definition of rape will, \"help ensure justice for those whose lives have been devastated by sexual violence and reflect the Department of Justice's commitment to standing with rape victims\".\n\nThe prior definition of rape &amp;mdash; \"the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will\" &amp;mdash; was set by the FBI in 1927. In contrast, the revised definition drops the requirement that there be physical resistance, thus including crimes where the victim is unable to give consent because they are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or due to their age.\n\nThe changes are primarily a revision to the Uniform Crime Reports system (UCR), and are not expected to impact prior cases or current prosecutions. Introducing no changes to current State or Federal law, the FBI expects the revised definition of rape will see victim numbers \"more accurately reflected in national crime statistics\".\n\nClose to the revised rape definition is a 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which included male rape and non-consensual sex; their figures indicate that, at some point in their lives, about 20% of women and 1.5% of men in the United States have been raped. Writing for Significance magazine, Stephanie Kovalchik says this report shows the US \"is experiencing an epidemic of sexual violence.\" Comparing with other CDC reports, she highlights \"that the number of American women who have been raped is greater than the number who are current smokers.\"\n\nVice President Joe Biden, with a history of advocating improved rape legislation, described the changes as \"a victory for women and men across the country whose suffering has gone unaccounted for over 80 years.\" Whilst still in the Senate, Biden led efforts to implement legislative change &amp;mdash; including authoring the Violence Against Women Act.",

    "original_text": "The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has released a comprehensive report on the current state of the global environment. Climate change, food and water shortage and a decline in biodiversity threaten humanity's survival, so urgent action is necessary, the report warns.\n\nUNEP's Global Environment Outlook: environment for development (GEO-4) report involved the work of about 390 experts in various fields from around the world.\n\n1=Selected key figures and facts from the report\nClimate change\n*The global average temperature has risen 0.7 °C since 1906 and will rise a further 1.8 °C at best by the end of this century.\n*Some scientists believe a 2°C temperature rise would cause major and irreversible damage.\n*Meanwhile, average temperatures in the Arctic are rising twice as fast as elsewhere.\n*Rising sealevels threaten the 60 percent of the population living within 100 kilometres of coastal lines.\nWater and food\n*Increasing irrigation demands will eventually cause 1 of every 10 major rivers to dry up.\n*Population growth, over-consumption and a continued shift from cereals to meat will raise food demand to a level 2.5 - 3.5 times higher than at present.\n*The slackening expansion of cropland stands in contrast with the fact that by 2030, developing countries will need 120 million extra hectares to feed themselves.\nBiodiversity\n*Species are becoming extinct a hundred times faster than the rate shown in the fossil record.\n\nWhile the GEO-4 report salutes some improvements, for example the increased public awareness of environmental issues and political interest, it also warns that \"There are no major issues... for which the foreseeable trends are favourable.\" Although the report sets out a gloomy scenario, its main aim is to call for action.\n\nThe report finds that despite \"visible and unequivocal\" evidence of climate change caused by human activity, the global response is \"woefully inadequate\" and shows \"a remarkable lack of urgency\". It criticizes highly-polluting countries that refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, and the industrial sectors that lobbied against it. Negotiations for a new Protocol to curb climate changes will start in December.\n\nAlthough the emission of ozone-layer damaging chemicals has decreased by 95 percent, the spring hole in the ozone layer is larger than ever. UNEP calls the way Europe and North America have dealt with the problem of acid rain \"one of the success stories of recent decades\", while the challenge remains in countries like China, India and Mexico.\n\nAs far as water is concerned, the report warns that \"The escalating burden of water demand will become intolerable in water-scarce countries.\" Contaminated water and lack of sanitation services already affect 2.6 billion people, being the single leading cause of death in developing countries with 3 million deaths annually, mostly in children younger than five. Although agricultural efficacy has increased, up to a third of the global population is affected by soil erosion, nutrient depletion and water scarcity.\n\nThis is the first UNEP report which addresses specific problems in individual continents. In Africa, desertification and declining food production are key problems, while agricultural subsidies in developing countries decrease trade profits. Bushmeat trade is also mentioned, for example in the Congo Basin, where the trade is at six times its sustainable rate. In Asia, urban air quality, fresh water and increasing waste problems are among the priorities. The illegal traffic in electronic and hazardous waste worldwide is mentioned separately as an emerging challenge.\n\nOverconsumption, high energy use and transport problems cause concern in Europe, while North America is, according to the report, struggling to address climate change. Urban growth is a particular concern in Latin America. 2007 is reported as being the first year in history when more than half of all people lived in cities. The Polar regions are already feeling the impact of climate change, ozone layer effacement and pollution.\n\nThe need couldn't be more urgent and the time couldn't be more opportune, with our enhanced understanding of the challenges we face, to act now to safeguard our own survival and that of future generations.\nAchim Steiner, Under-Secretary General of the U.N. and director of UNEP, said that \"There continue to be 'persistent' and intractable problems unresolved and unaddressed. ... Meanwhile, institutions like UNEP, established to counter the root causes, remain under-resourced and weak.\"\n\n\"There have been enough wake-up calls ... I sincerely hope GEO-4 is the final one. The systematic destruction of the Earth's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged and where the bill we hand on to our children may prove impossible to pay,\" Mr Steiner warned.",

The phone went on sale on Friday morning around the world. According to CNN, around 300 people were queuing outside Apple's New York store while employees were briefed inside.\n\nLines however, were not as long as was anticipated, with surplus metal barriers outside stores. An Apple employee was quoted as saying that the lines were shorter than this time last year.\n\nThe new iPhone contains a faster processor, a digital compass and a video camera. Ever since the launch of the original iPhone two years ago, it has been praised for \"making smartphones cool\", with over 17 million handsets being sold.\n\nHowever, critics have said that the new update deals are too costly. The telecommunications company O2 has made owners of Apple's current iPhone products buy out their contracts should they wish to purchase the new phone.",

    "original_text": "The Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) say ex-tropical cyclone \"Emma\" has weakened below tropical cyclone intensity, after crossing the coast at 11am WST near Mardie in Western Australia (WA) today. Widespread squally thunderstorms with heavy rain and flooding are expected as the system moves further south. Approximately 280 millimetres of rain was recorded at Karratha in 36 hours.\n\nThe cyclone bore down on Australia's Pilbara region, bringing with it winds of up to 105kph. Dampier's port was closed, some flights to the region were cancelled and communities in the storm's path were battening down.\n\nCyclone Emma was west of Karratha and northeast of Onslow at 8am (WST) today, and travelling south at 23kph. The weather bureau said by the time the category one storm crosses the coast between Dampier and Onslow the worst of the weather will have passed.\n\n\"Most of the weather is travelling ahead of the system\", weather forecaster Andrew Burton said. \"They've probably had the worst weather by now, and by the time the system crosses the coast it will all be over really.\"\n\nPeople near the communities of Onslow, Karratha, Dampier, Mardie, Point Sampson, Roebourne and Wickham were warned the storm could cause gales with gusts of up to 105kph. At Karratha, torrential rain has left parts of the town awash. Roebourne shire airport spokesman Alan Wright said there was flooding on the road to Karratha airport.\n\nSix people were rescued after two cars were swept away by flood water dumped by the cyclone, oil and mining operations were shut down, Karratha, Tom Price and Pannawonica suffered localised flooding and three Pilbara schools had minor classroom and roof damage.\n\nFire and Emergency Services (FESA) issued an \"all clear with caution\" alert an hour after Emma crossed the coast and began breaking up as it moved inland. A spokesperson said: \"With a category one cyclone you are not looking at destructive winds and in this case the rain that preceded the cyclone was the biggest issue. But residents should only proceed outside with caution as there may be downed powerlines, fallen trees, broken water and sewage lines, loose roof sheeting and debris.\"\n\nCyclone Emma's approach sparked a series of precautionary shutdowns of mining, oil and shipping operations. Open cut mining operations around Tom Price were shut. Guests at the Fortescue River Roadhouse, 1425km north of Perth, were stranded because of flooding.\n\nThe weather also forced Woodside Mining to cease production at two of its operations in the Pilbara region. The company said it expected no major impact from the production interruption at the North West Shelf with operations to start producing again when the weather improves.\n\nCyclone Emma is the third cyclone of WA's cyclone season, which runs between November and April, with most activity in the latter half of the period. The Bureau of Meteorology say they are watching another developing tropical low that could impact WA over the weekend.\n\nThe first major tropical storm this year was category three cyclone Clare which battered Dampier and brought flooding rains to mining regions and much of the wheatbelt in early January. A week later category two cyclone Daryl threatened North West WA but moved off the coast.",

Now, in the run-up to a May 5 general election and with no evidence of a serious threat from pre-invasion Iraq having come to light, a furor has erupted over the issue.\n\nHigh-ranking governmental legal advisor, Elizabeth Wilmshurst, protested in her resignation letter just prior to the invasion, about sudden, unexplained changes the Attorney General had made in the tone of his legal advice to the government. In the space of a few weeks, Lord Goldsmith dropped suggestions that the government may have been legally culpable if it invaded without receiving specific support in the form of a new UN Resolution.\n\nWhen the BBC News website finally obtained Wilmshurt's resignation letter under Freedom of Information, her protest over the Attorney General's unexplained turnaround was obscured.\n\nThe missing paragraph was later obtained by Channel 4 News:\n\n\"My views accord with the advice that has been given consistently in this office before and after the adoption of UN security council resolution 1441 and with what the attorney general gave us to understand was his view prior to his letter of 7 March. (The view expressed in that letter has of course changed again into what is now the official line.)\"\n\nConservative party leader Michael Howard, wants to know what made Lord Goldsmith change his advice to the government. He told Channel Four, \"The Prime Minister Tony Blair has said that the attorney general's advice given to the cabinet on the 17 of March was clear and the attorney general did not change that advice. Well, we now know the attorney general did change that advice and the question is what or who changed it.\"\n\nForeign Secretary Jack Straw, in a statement last month, read in both houses of parliament, defended initially censoring the letter on privacy grounds, and the later omission of the two revealing lines \"because their content concerned the provision of legal advice in relation to the use of force against Iraq.\"\n\nAlthough Ms Wilmshurst describes the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's 13-page, March 7 letter as being a change to his previously expressed view against a war without specific UN support, even this letter expressed serious misgivings, according to both Channel 4 and the Guardian.\n\nFurther refinements brought his advice to a short 300 word 'summary' delivered to cabinet on March 17, giving a full go-ahead for invasion. The letter was not published, according to Philippe Sands in the Guardian, a breach of ministerial protocol. Both letters have since been obtained by both the Guardian and Channel 4.\n\nAccording to Mr Straw in Parliament last month, \"The Attorney-General made clear in his March 17 advice his genuinely and independently-held view that military action in Iraq was lawful on the basis of Saddam's breach of the existing UN resolutions,\".\n\nBut in the earlier and longer version, the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith had written, \"I remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force.\"\n\nIn the absence of such a resolution, he added, if war was pursued, \"we would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-cooperation.\"\n\nWhen the later, short version was put before cabinet, no-one asked what this hard evidence might be, that supposedly showed Iraq was in breach of UN Resolutions 1441, 678 and 687, despite the possibility that without such evidence, the UK might be on shaky legal ground and accused of launching a war of aggression.\n\n\"So concerned was the government about the possibility of such a legal case that it took steps to put together a legal team to prepare for possible international litigation,\" he wrote, in a Guardian story in February, which examined the two letters of legal advice.\n\nThe final report by the post-invasion Iraq Survey Group &amp;mdash; \"the best picture that could be drawn concerning the events, programs, policies, and underlying dynamics of the relationship of the former Regime to WMD over the last three decades\", according to the team head, CIA Special Advisor Charles Duelfer &amp;mdash; concludes that Iraq was not capable of any WMD-related threat at the time of the invasion, and that the sanctions were still limiting the ability to develop any capability.\n\nIran was the country Saddam was most afraid of, Iraq had no written strategy for WMD development, and the closest thing to actual WMDs mentioned seems to be preliminary designs for missile delivery systems that could have exceeded the UN-specified range limit of 150km for Iraqi missiles under the sanction regime.",

The week-long celebration of women was started in 2006 to highlight the importance of women to the sport and make the game female-friendlier.\n\nThe NRL is planning to celebrate the week in a number of ways, including having teams compete in pink uniforms, and having fans vote for the NRL player fans believe \"acts as a role model for mothers and families; someone who continues to impress us on the field, however their off-field characteristics embody what it is we love about rugby league\". Additionally, funds are to be raised for the McGrath Foundation, a charity dedicated to breast cancer support and education, and the Women in League Achievement Award will be given out with the winner earning a AU$5,000 gift card to Harvey Norman, an Australian electronics store.\n\nThe NRL has been promoting the event on their Women in League Facebook page. In the past month, their Facebook updates have included posts featuring male players discussing support they received from women in their lives, sales of pink coloured NRL merchandise, plugs encouraging people to vote for their favourite son, pictures of men supporting Women in League, NRL club promotions for tickets and other events connected to Women in League, and information on a school visit promoting anti-bullying. The Facebook page has also promoted women's participation and profiles of women's players as recently as a month ago, when on April 9, it promoted the Girls 'Come and Try' Day in Canberra. Prior to that, women were last promoted as players on February 10 when pictures were shared of the Women's All Stars team match with the Indigenous All Stars team.\n\n140,000 women in Australia are involved with rugby league as players, sport administrators, coaches, employees, club members, or volunteers. Karen Hardy of The Canberra Times estimates this number could easily be quadrupled if wives, girlfriends, mothers, and other female family members who support male players were included. Participation is also increasing, with almost a thousand new female players taking up the sport between 2011 and 2012 for 5,801 total registered female players in 2012.",

It remains unclear what the eventual outcome will be.\n\nIn 38 constituencies, Thai Rak Thai (lit. Thais love Thais) stood unopposed and failed to garner support from the required 20% of eligible voters. Seven of those 38 may face the same ballot choice in the upcoming April 23 by-elections, according to the Thai-based English-language newspaper, the Bangkok Post. A repeat of the mass abstention that saw TRT resoundingly rejected in the south would leave the lower house of the parliament short of the required 500 seats and, according to the country's constitution, unable to convene and elect a prime minister. A reading of the constitution reveals that the only likely fallback position would involve intervention from the monarch.\n\nLeaders of the PAD (People's Alliance for Democracy), who have spearheaded the campaign to bring down the Prime Minister, may face arrest, according to a report from the Thai News Agency. Protests organised by the PAD have been peaceful, and no specific charges that may be used against the organisation's leaders are given in the TNA report.",

Their joint press release described this as a \"construction blitz on the line\", with the goal of delivering nine daily return services between Melbourne and Shepparton. As of January 31, V/Line operates five return services on weekdays to Shepparton.\n\nFrom September 4 to September 12, coaches will replace trains to Seymour and Shepparton, during which stage two works will continue on the line, while as part of the stage three upgrades, the crossing loop at Murchison East will be extended by 1.1 kilometres, allowing two six-car V/Line VLocity trains to pass each other.\n\nOutside of these dates, the stage three upgrades will also involve the expansion of a new Shepparton train stabling facility, as well as signalling and track upgrades on the Shepparton railway line. The stabling facility and loop extension, along with stage two upgrades, have been contracted to Coleman Rail and KBR. Stage three is slated for completion by 2023.\n\nAustralian Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, and leader of the National Party of Australia, Barnaby Joyce, said of the upgrades that \"the Australian Government provided the funding for stage three to deliver the services Shepparton passengers have been waiting for, and now we’re making sure this work gets underway. Our record $110 billion infrastructure investment is all about delivering projects like this, where the community and the economy will benefit simultaneously.\"\n\nA number of local MPs also spoke on the project, with National Party federal MP for Nicholls, Damian Drum, saying that \"these upgrades will give Shepparton the fast and frequent rail service befitting its status as a major regional centre.\"\n\nMark Gepp, a Labor state MLC for the Northern Victoria Region (which covers Shepparton) stated that \"delivering four extra services to and from Shepparton each day will give people in communities along the line more options for their travel and a train service they can rely on\".\n\nLiberal Democratic MLC for Northern Victoria, Tim Quilty, told Wikinews yesterday via email that \"I am very pleased to see the Victorian Government actually invest in rail infrastructure to benefit Northern Victorian communities. More efficient and reliable freight and passenger transport will benefit the city’s economy and help ease traffic on our roads.\"\n\nQuilty added that \"Shepparton is an important regional centre and this investment should continue to improve transport links – with nine passenger services a day, lots of Northern Victorian towns will be envious of the service Shepparton is going to have,\" but also commented on the government's announcements, remarking that \"you have to wonder, though, just how many times they can announce the same project before the next election. It would be great if they would shut up about how they are going to build it, and just get on with it.\"",

On Wednesday, the entire section was removed and replaced with a new one. When oil was reintroduced on Thursday morning, oil leaked where the new section joined the pre-existing pipe, triggering the fatal explosion.\n\nThe fire was extinguished later the same day.\n\nThe line is split between four separate pipes. After the explosion, all four pipes were shut down, resulting in the global price surge, but this subsided for the most part after it became clear that the three undamaged pipelines had returned to normal operation, restoring 80% of the line's capacity, and that the accident pipe is expected to be back in use in a matter of days.\n\n\"There were no problems found in that area where the leak occurred,\" reporters were told by Larry Springer, spokesman for Enbridge, the Canadian company that owns the line. High-tech equipment had been through the line in 2006 to check for any signs of problems.\n\nEnbridge identified the deceased as Dave Mussati Jr. and Steve Arnovich, both of whom were contract workers based in Superior, Wisconsin. The damaged section of pipe is in Clearbrook, which is approximately 350 miles Northwest of Minneapolis.\n\nEnbridge metallurgists have been sent to examine the failed section in an effort to determin the cause of the accident.

The freelance journalists were arrested after entering from neighboring country Somalia without permission. They allegedly aided a terrorist group and were wounded in a gunfight, in which 15 rebels were killed.\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi says the two imprisoned Swedish journalists \"made their way into Ethiopia with a terrorist organization that had killed 70 people who worked for a mining company in an attack.\" He says \"I think it would be a criminal relationship in any country\".\n4=Meles Zenawi\n\"They are, at the very least, messenger boys of a terrorist organization. They are not journalists,\" the prime minister said. \"Why would a journalist be involved with a terrorist organization and enter a country with that terrorist organization, escorted by armed terrorists, and participate in a fighting in which this terrorist organization was involved? If that is journalism, I don't know what terrorism is,\" says Zenawi.\n\nThe journalists were jailed after entering into Ethiopia's troubled Ogaden region to cover rebel activity in the area. Zenawi claims one of the journalists was arrested on a previous attempt to enter illegally. \"The second time he was seized with a terrorist organization in combat.\"\n\nThe Swedes were found travelling with the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), and were investigating actions by a company with ties to Sweden's Lundin Petroleum, oil group, and claims of human rights violations in the Ogaden region.\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt has been criticised for inaction post-arrests. Kerstin Lundell, who wrote a book on Lundin in Africa, says \"the fact that Carl Bildt has reason to hide what is going on in Ogaden could explain why these journalists are still in prison.\"\n\nBildt Lundin board member but left previous to the firm gaining an Ethiopian concession for oil exploration.\n\nJournalist Anna Roxvall, who is acting as facilitator of the Swedish journalists says the claim that one of the journalists was arrested previously is wrong. \"No, no, no. It is clean cut a lie\", she says.\n\nSveriges Radio, Sveriges Television, TT and Dagens Nyheter journalists applied for visa to attend the trial but were originally denied entry to the country. Ola Larsmo, writer and chairman of the Swedish Pen says access to information will be restricted if Swedish journalists do not attend. Zenawi says \"we do not need to Swedish journalists to prove that our courts operate in accordance with international standards.\"\n\nAmongst the crowded court audience were eighteen Swedish journalists and several Western diplomats, including US ambassador to Ethiopia Donald Booth.\n\nVoice of America says legal experts expect a quick resolution. The accused's lawyers claim a four-to-six month trial is likely. An unnamed attorney close to the trial has claimed a negotiated settlement is still possible. The two journalists face fifteen years in prison if convicted of engaging in terrorist activity. The trial is scheduled to resume tomorrow.",

Despite the news, some EU economies including Spain and the United Kingdom are still struggling.\n\nBoth the European Union as a whole and the sixteen EU countries sharing the euro currency (the \"eurozone\") posted positive growth, at 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. This follows five consecutive quarters of negative growth. The data was published by the European statistical agency Eurostat and announced by the European Commission in Brussels.\n\nTwo of Europe's biggest economies, France and Germany, helped drive the overall growth. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde announced the French economy had grown 0.3 percent in the third quarter, and predicted it would enter 2010 with its old momentum.\n\nIn an interview on French radio, Lagarde said the fact the French economy had posted two successive quarters of positive growth showed it was turning around. She also noted that the labour market had only shed 5,000 jobs in the last quarter, far fewer than at the beginning of the year. Speaking from Singapore, Lagarde predicted Asia would drive the world economic recovery &amp;mdash; but she also said it was important to continue government economic stimulus measures through 2010.\n\nGermany's economy grew 0.7 percent in the third quarter and Italy and the Netherlands also posted an upturn. Lithuania recorded the biggest growth &amp;mdash; up 6 percent in the third quarter.\n\nHowever the economies of both Spain and the United Kingdom shrunk in the same quarter. The UK's Office for National Statistics initially estimated a fall of 0.4 percent in British output, though this could be revised. Britain had widely been expected to show growth in the third quarter. Eurostat figures also showed that unemployment in Europe overall rose to 9.7 percent in September &amp;mdash; the highest in 20 years.\n\nSome economists believe that growth in Europe and the United States may slow or even reverse in 2010, in a so called \"double-dip\". Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight warned that the end of some government stimulus such as car scrappage schemes could cause a \"loss of momentum\". Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the IMF, disagreed, predicting in a statement from Singapore that 2010 would be a global \"year of recovery\".",

Scores of opposition figures were among those detained.\n\nJaved Hashmi, a leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) party, the party of exiled former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was arrested. \"Musharraf's days are numbered. The time has come to end the political role of the army,\" he told reporters in Multan before being taken away by police. Nawaz Sharif said to an Indian news channel: \"We have not witnessed such a grave situation in the 60 years of Pakistan's history.\"\n\nAlso arrested were pro-democracy attorney, Munir Malik, and the leader of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, Asma Jehangir. Both have been involved in protests against Musharraf in past years. Troops also arrested the staff of the Commission and began to close off and surround government buildings.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who recently returned home, addressed supporters in Karachi. \"This is a situation worse than an emergency. The people of Pakistan will not accept this,\" Bhutto said.\n\nOn Saturday, Musharraf laid out his reasons for the emergency rule. \"Please do not expect or demand your level of democracy, which you learned over a number of centuries. Please also do not demand or expect your number of civil rights, human rights or civil liberties … Please give us time. For me and every Pakistani, Pakistan comes first,\" said Musharraf in a statement.\n\nIn a \"charge sheet\" levied against the judiciary, the government said: \"... (T)here has been increasing interference by some members of the judiciary in government policy, adversely affecting economic growth, in particular,\" adding that there was \"constant interference in executive functions.\"\n\nThe government further accused the judiciary of having \"weakened the writ of the government, the police force ... been completely demoralised and ...fast losing its efficacy to fight terrorism, and intelligence agencies ... thwarted in their activities and prevented from pursuing terrorists.\"\n\nParliamentary elections may be delayed. The current Prime Minister, Shaukat Aziz said, at a news conference, that the government is still committed to democracy, but \"the government is deliberating on the election schedule.\"\n\n\"Now that we have emergency rule, parliament's term can be extended by one year,\" said Aziz. Pakistan was due to have a general election on January 15, 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has said it will review the financial aid that is providing Pakistan. United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told reporters, while in Jerusalem: \"Obviously we are going to have to review the situation with aid, in part because we have to see what may be triggered by certain statutes.\"\n\nThe US has given an estimated US$10 billion in aid to Pakistan since 2001, primarily for counter-terrorism. This year Pakistan is receiving about $700 million in assistance.\n\n\"We have to be very cognizant of the fact that some of the assistance that has been going directly to Pakistan is directly related to counter-terrorism missions. This is a complicated matter,\" Rice said. She also condemned the declaration of emergency rule, saying \"it's highly regrettable that Pakistan's president has declared a state of martial law. The U.S. does not support extra constitutional measures.\"\n\nUS Senator Joe Biden, the chairperson on the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations agreed that a review is needed. \"I'm not sure how much good that military aid we're giving him to fight the extremists is doing us anyway,\" he said on television program, Face the Nation.\n\nTony Blair, special envoy for the Quartet on the Middle East said on Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer: \"The sooner that we return to the pledges to restore democracy that were set out, the better. But it's a very, very difficult situation this indeed, and it's a situation that if it's not resolved in the right way, I think it's extremely worrying for the whole of the world, not just for Pakistan.\"",

    "original_text": "On Sunday, US television station CBS aired \"The Vulcan Hello\", the premiere episode of Star Trek: Discovery. The episode is slated to be the only one of the series broadcast on conventional television, with future installments exclusive to streaming platform CBS All Access. Discovery continues the long-running Star Trek franchise with the first series in the franchise to feature a black female lead.\n\nThe airing follows several months of development and delays, as the series was retooled by veteran television producers including Bryan Fuller and Akiva Goldsman. Initially announced in 2015 to celebrate Star Treks 50th anniversary the following year, the series has been plagued by setbacks, including departure of Bryan Fuller as showrunner in late 2016, collectively pushing its release date to move from January to September of this year.\n\nOnly Canadian station Space is to air the series on traditional television. In all other non-US countries, Netflix has the rights.\n\nThe series is the newest installment of the Star Trek media franchise. Discovery is a prequel program set before the 1960s original series, set to explore the relationship between the Earth-based Federation made up of several benign alien species who explore the universe to find new life, and the war-like Klingons who have been villains of the various films and television installments. Veteran US television actress Sonequa Martin-Green stars as Michael Burnham, first officer of starship USS Shenzou.\n\nThe series has earned praise and controversy for its decision to cast the lead as a black woman. Creators say this inclusivity is consistent with the franchise's history, which has featured black male and white female leads. All casts have been multi-racial, starting with the original series, which included the black female character Uhura portrayed by Nichelle Nichols.\n\nDiscovery also marks a key part of CBS's strategy for streaming its streaming video service All Access. Launched in 2014, the platform has a library of several thousand episodes from the network's past programming as well as debuting two spin-off series: Big Brother: Over the Top, from the reality television franchise Big Brother, and the legal procedural The Good Fight, from The Good Wife. The CBS Corporation is using this drama as an incentive for signing up to their service, which competes with industry giants Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Hulu. Hulu is a joint venture including many of the broadcast networks in the United States but CBS only began sharing selected programming on this platform earlier this year. CBS claimed the debut resulted in their biggest surge in membership, without offering hard numbers.",

The gunman is numbered among the dead, after taking his own life. Ten people are reported injured during the attack by a man identified as Wellington Menezes Olivera, a 23 year old ex-student from the school.\n\nThe attack took place just after 8am local time (11:00 GMT) this morning. Television station TV Globo reported that Olivera entered the Tasso da Silveira municipal school, telling officials that he was attending to make a speech to students. He was reportedly carrying at least two revolvers and a significant amount of ammunition.\n\nWitnesses state that he began to fire at pupils' heads, killing ten girls and one boy. Rio state health secretary, Sergio Cortes, stated that those injured in the attack were taken to local hospitals. At least four were said to be in a \"grave\" condition.\n\nRio's Police chief, Martha Rocha, said in a press conference that the gunman had no previous criminal history. She stated that he was carrying 2 firearms, although she did not specify what type. During the attack he fired off at least 30 rounds of ammunition. There were approximately 400 people in the school when the attack began, and shortly after the shooting started, two small boys outside the school, one with a gunshot wound, ran almost two city blocks until they found police and alerted them to the incident.\n4=Mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes\nThe two officers who were made aware ran to the school, and quickly managed to locate the gunman, leading to a shooting match. One officer, Marcio Alves, stated that \"He saw me and aimed a gun at me, I shot him in the legs, he fell down the stairs and then shot himself in the head.\"\n\nPolice report that Olivera was carrying a \"long and rambling\" letter, confirming his intentions to commit suicide.\n\nIn a statement by the Mayor of Rio, Eduardo Paes, he made it clear that life at the school had become a \"hellish nightmare.\" Authorities closed the school temporarily while they investigate, but Mayor Paes confirmed that the school will reopen.\n\nThe fate of all the children in the school is not yet known. One eleven year old pupil from the school, Wanderson Barbosa, was interviewed by Associated Press as he sat on the steps of his house. He was in his classroom when the attack started, and he and others in his class thought that other students were fighting, until his teacher told them to get to the floor, because it was gunfire.\n\n\"I'm so worried,\" Barbosa said to reporters, \"We don't have news of everyone yet.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rio's Governor, Sergio Cabral, called the attacker a \"psychopath\", whilst indicating that he does not believe anyone else was involved in the attack, but that investigations into the incident will continue.",

    "original_text": "The price for a barrel of oil dropped after news broke that Al Qaeda's leader in Iraq Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had been killed in a US airstrike Thursday. The death of al-Zarqawi seems to have been interpreted by the market as good news for the future supply of oil from the region.\n\nThis is against the backdrop in 2006 when the price of oil had reached a record high of $70 a barrel.\n\nToday on the New York Mercantile Exchange light crude futures for July dropped from over $70 a barrel to a low of $69.54 before rising to $69.63 for a $1.19 loss. \"There's less of a terror threat in Iraq now,\" said Naohiro Niimura, vice president of energy derivatives at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd, in Tokyo, who gave his reason for the fall.\n\nIraq lies over one-third of known oil reserves but since the Iraq war in 2003 has been unable to pump more than 2 million barrels a day - 1 million less than prior to the coalition invasion. In May exports were said to be 1.5 million bpd.\n\nThe line on a graph that plotted oil price had done a steady incline over recent years, though many factors are involved in the price of a barrel of oil so it is almost impossible to say how much the troubles in Iraq contributed to this rise.\n\nIraq's exports make up the largest proportion of its Gross Domestic Product and a significant proportion of world supply. Investors were said to have been worried about developing in the country citing lack of security and legal protection.\n\nAl-Zarqawi, known for videotaped beheadings, suicide bombing campaigns against coalition forces and civilians and reportedly some attacks on oil infrastructure inside Iraq, had claimed responsibility for bombing three hotels in Amman, Jordan. It was hoped the death of Osama bin Laden's operative in Iraq would remove a man who had opposed the US-backed Shiite-led state and western influence in the wider-region.\n\nThe Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's recent appointment of new security and home affairs ministers also may have affected the oil market. Director general of marketing and economics at the Iraqi oil ministry said both pieces of news together were \"a positive indicator for security,\" said Shamkhi Faraj.\n\nOther voices sounded a note of caution against the optimism: \"The situation in Iraq has now become so chaotic, that it transcends the death of one man, influential as al-Zarqawi was,\" said Edward Meir.\n\nThe analyst at Man Financial believes the threat to the Iraqi oil industry is political as well as physical.\n\n\"Yes, al Qaeda attacked oil installations but they were not the only actors and they were not the main actors,\" he said. \"There is also a new factor -- political parties that are using threats against oil to gain leverage.\"\n\nIn an announcement about oil, Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih of the Iraqi government said it hoped to produce 4.3 million bpd in four years.",

Other roads in the area, including other parts of State Highway 1 between Bulls and Turangi, State Highway 4, via National Park, and 49, via Ohakune, were closed at 8 PM.\n\nThese road closures stopped all traffic through the centre of the North Island. About 200 travellers were reported to have spent the night at the Waiouru Army Camp, being accommodated in the Marae and the Barracks. Grit trucks and snow ploughs worked overnight to clear the snow and reopen roads, with the Desert Road finally being reopened about 12:30 PM Saturday.\n\nTogether with a slip threatening to close State Highway 3 in the Manawatu Gorge and damage to State Highway 2 after floods in the Bay of Plenty a couple of weeks ago, the only reliable alternative route for travellers around the North Island was via Wanganui and Taranaki.\n\nIn the South Island, Police and the AA advised that chains were essential when travelling over the mountain passes.\n\nYesterday, Mount Hutt skifield announced it would be opening Saturday morning.

However, the Dalai Lama's recent visits to countries around the world is one factor and China says he is pushing to separate Tibet, but he said he wants autonomy, not separatism. There is an unofficial report that the Dalai Lama will be meeting with Pope Benedict XVI on December 13, but the Vatican has not yet commented on whether this is true.\n\n\"We express strong dissatisfaction with Monday's meeting,\" said ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao. \"We hope they can reflect on and correct the erroneous actions.\"\n\n\"It is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and has severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and will gravely undermine the relationship between China and Canada,\" said political counsellor, Sun Lushan.\n\nThe Dalai Lama told Prime Minister Stephen Harper during their meeting on Monday to \"please take a few thousand more\" Tibetan refugees living in exile in Nepal and India, but a spokesman for Immigration Minister Diane Finley said \"According to the UNHCR, they're not facing persecution in India. But having said that, we are prepared to review applications on a case-by-case basis if they're referred to us by the UNHCR.\"\n\nSecretary of state for multiculturalism Jason Kenney, who is a defender of human rights, particularly freedom of religion, said he hopes the \"entire world gets the message that attacking a 72-year-old Buddhist monk who advocates nothing more than cultural autonomy for his people is counterproductive.\" He also said exports to China and Chinese tourism rose after the Dalai Lama was given honorary citizenship in July 2006.",

The publication of the correspondence of the late Archbishop will be the result of co-operation between the Theology School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the non-governmental Institute for National and Religious Studies and the program Ecumenical Hellenism.\n\nAccording to Athanasios Angelopoulos — who, along with theology professor Athanasios Karathanasis and political science student Nicolaos Mottas, has the scientific diligence of the project — the personal correspondence of Iakovos contains important information about the national issues of Greece, such as the Cyprus, Macedonian and the northern Epirus issues.\n\nA dynamic personality, the spiritual leader of the Greek Orthodox community in the United States from 1959 to 1996, Iakovos, constructed relations with all the American presidents, from Harry Truman to Bill Clinton, and with various personalities from the Americas, such as minority leaders, with most famous being his friendship with Martin Luther King Jr. The personal correspondence of the Greek Orthodox leader contains letters between Iakovos and various United States presidents, including John F.

El-Faisal was recently released from a British prison where he spent the last four years of his life for his role in various terrorist plots, including the July 2005 London Bombings.\n\nAfter being refused entry to his native Jamaica in addition to several East African nations, el-Faisal entered Kenya on December 24, 2009 after having gone via Nigeria, Angola, Mozambique, Swaziland, Malawi, and Tanzania. Kenyan authorities arrested him after he was red-flagged in an immigration database.\n\nWhat was at first a peaceful protest by youth members of a local group known as the Muslim Human Rights Forum soon turned violent as the demonstrators started to pelt riot police with stones and other objects. In turn, officers retaliated at first with tear gas and water cannons, but as matters further deteriorated and some protesters attempted to stab them, the officers began to employ live ammunition, firing it into the crowd.\n\nLater in the day as the situation continued to deteriorate, scores of uninvolved civilians&amp;mdash;for reasons still unknown by the media&amp;mdash;got into the scuffle on the side of the police.\n\nFurthermore, shops adjacent to where the protest was taking place were looted and vehicles that were parked on the streets were totalled in the midst of all that was transpiring.\n\nAt a news conference blocks away, government spokesperson Alfred Mutua declined to comment both on the details and the police department's handling of the demonstration. However he did say that \"the government of Kenya is aware Mr. Abdullah el-Faisal has been deported from several countries for alleged recruitment, inspiration and advocating of suicide bombers. Mr. el-Faisal is a threat to this country, because of his alleged tendencies to recruit suicide bombers.\"\n\nMore than 300 miles away in Mombasa, Muslims held a similar demonstration on el-Faisal's behalf that ended peacefully.\n\nMutua reiterated the Immigration Ministry's prior statement that el-Faisal will remain imprisoned in Kenya until they are able to send him back to Jamaica, whose government already made clear that they would not receive him.\n\n\"This man is so dangerous,\" said Mutua. \"No country wants to touch him.\"",

    "original_text": "UK\nUnited Kingdom prime minister Gordon Brown and Irish premier Brian Cowen have left Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland, where they had been attending talks on justice and the recent Northern Ireland crisis regarding the devolution of policing and justice powers from London to Belfast. No agreement has yet been reached, and the main parties have been given two more days to attempt to broker a deal.\n\nMartin McGuinness, the deputy first minister and member of the republican party Sinn Féin, was \"deeply disappointed\" by the lack of an agreement on the possible devolution of Northern Ireland's policing and justice powers from Westminster, London to Stormont, Belfast. Brown, however, believes the discussions are salvageable. He said that there is the \"prospect of a reasonable agreement\" being reached within the next two days, and that they \"have the pathway to an agreement\" in place. The British unionist Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin—Northern Ireland's two largest parties—have been arguing over the issue for some time.\n\nOn Monday, Brown and Cowen travelled to Hillsborough Castle to meet with delegates of Northern Ireland's major parties in an attempt to forge an agreement, and—before he left—Brown gave the remaining delegates 48 hours to find a mutually beneficial solution. He said that the governments of the UK and Ireland will publish their plans if no such agreement is reached. He also said that the devolution could occur \"around the beginning of May\" this year. Sinn Féin want the devolution to occur as soon as possible, but the DUP argues that \"community confidence\" is required before the process, which would give Northern Ireland its first justice minister, can begin.\nsource=Martin McGuinness\nMcGuinness said, \"We have not concluded a deal today and I am deeply disappointed about that. We intend to study the governments' statement.\" He said that his party would refuse to give its support to anything that subjected \"citizens' rights\" to a \"unionist veto\". Peter Robinson, the leader of the DUP who has been forced to temporarily stand aside as first minister due to a sexual and financial scandal involving his wife, said that his party would not accept a \"second-rate deal\" in order to keep to \"someone else's time limit\". He is also reported as saying, \"We are not prepared to buy a pig in a poke. We will do what is right for our community.\" Sinn Féin has accused the DUP of stalling for time, though Robinson denied this, saying that \"the party has always wanted to see the devolution of policing and justice and has always wanted it to happen without undue delay but it has to happen on a basis that we believe is sustainable\".\n\nsource=Peter RobinsonIt is thought that a failure to come to an agreement could trigger a re-election in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and damage the delicate peace process, which began with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Margaret O'Callaghan, of Queen's University Belfast said, \"It's difficult to overestimate just how bad relations are between them. They really do not get on. On the other hand people have too much invested in this to allow it to collapse.\"",

Facing an appeal before the United States Anti-Doping Agency next year, Landis dubbed this approach \"the Wikipedia defense\".\n\nLandis said on October 12, 2006 that he had published a number of documents in the case \"to support his innocence in the alleged positive doping test\". These included his attorney's motion for dismissal, a document package containing test information, and a PowerPoint presentation criticizing the test. This action earned considerable but sometimes-skeptical media coverage in the ongoing saga over the disputed race.\n\nLandis did not set up an actual wiki, but attempted to draw on the collective resources of cycling fans, using the Internet to allow widely distributed review of evidence in his case. He succeeded in getting the community to establish its own wiki independent of him personally, based largely on the Daily Peloton Forum discussions noted below. The topic had already drawn intense interest in a variety of places, including Landis's Wikipedia entry, which has figured as something of a battleground. The release serves as both a public relations strategy and a way to potentially strengthen his appeal. As Landis put it, \"Why turn down free brainpower?\"\n\nIn anticipation of the release of these documents, Landis had been personally posting on the forums at the Daily Peloton cycling website. He is largely out of action while rehabilitating from hip resurfacing surgery performed in September. As the documents were about to be released, Landis said, \"I am sure you guys will find every mistake, even things we haven't noticed.\"\n\nIn forum discussions, Landis agreed with sympathetic posters who pointed to this as a \"wisdom of crowds\" approach, while asking others not to judge him based on incomplete information from media reports. He encouraged people to look at all of the evidence, saying, \"We'll call it the Wikipedia defense, and I would have given everything to you sooner but had a very hard time selling the idea to the lawyers.\" At the same time, he said that not all of his arguments against the test had been revealed: \"We are not going to compromise our defense by telling all of it.\"",

    "original_text": "NASA has issued a report on survivability during the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, entitled \"Columbia Crew Survival Investigation Report\". Although the report finds the accident was impossible to survive, it still faulted a number of design issues with the astronauts' equipment.\n\nThe accident investigation report was released in 2003, the year of the crash. During launch on January 16, the spacecraft's wing was holed when a chunk of foam detached and struck it. The shuttle then broke up on re-entry on February 1 over Texas, killing the seven on board.\n\nThis new report reveals details of what happened to the astronauts during the accident sequence, although some parts have remained confidential to the victims' families. The report reveals that within seconds of the breakup commencing the crew became unconscious due to the rapid depressurization and that they never regained consciousness prior to their deaths.\n\nThe report notes that the cabin began spinning wildly, causing some of the astronauts' helmets to come off. The report noted that most on board were secured only by lap harnesses that offered no restraint to the upper body and were not designed to cope with sideways motion, meaning \"lethal trauma\" was caused by the rotation. However, the report was unable to determine whether the astronauts had died from oxygen deprivation or the extreme nature of their injuries.\n\nThe pressure suits the crew wore, introduced after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, were criticised as the crew could not keep their visors down throughout re-entry due to a design limitation that would have caused excess levels of oxygen to be present had they done so, leaving the suits unsealed. The gloves also made many tasks difficult or impossible. When the accident occurred, three people were not wearing gloves, one was not wearing a helmet, and none had their visors down. The helmets also did not conform to the heads of the wearers.\n\nUpon disintegration, the occupants were exposed to extreme heat and high friction from re-entry. The astronauts likely died very quickly, and were probably dead by the time Columbia broke apart.\n\nThe report added that although the crew all wore parachutes, they had to be activated by the crew &amp;mdash; impossible as they were unconscious. The report concluded that future spacecraft require sturdier construction and better restraints, while safety devices should be automatic. NASA is designing better suits and helmets.",

Over seventy percent of all visitors will come from Hong Kong and mainland China.",

    "original_text": "Sam Brownback is perplexed. The U.S. Senator from Kansas and Presidential candidate is a Republican whose politics—he is against marriage for gay people, he is against abortion, and he has a clean image in a party tainted by scandal—should speak favorably to the party's base. But it has not. \"I'm baffled by that myself,\" Senator Brownback told Wikinews reporter David Shankbone. \"We haven't been able to raise money.\"\n\nA recent poll in Iowa has put him in eighth place, with 2% supporting his campaign. \"If we don't finish fourth or better in Iowa...we'll pull out.\"\n\nSenator Brownback's relationship with God infuses almost every answer you find below. Although he doesn't feel \"competent\" to explain why God would dislike gays, he does feel strongly that allowing two men or two women to enter into the union of marriage will destroy it for heterosexuals. Pointing to the research of Stanley Kurtz at the Hoover Institution, Brownback asserts that Northern Europeans have \"taken the sacredness out of the institution.\"\n\nIn the interview, Senator Brownback discusses the tug-and-pull that befalls him when his constituents show up at his office and say, \"Look, I'm a conservative, but we need this bridge, we need this subsidy, we need this hospital.” Brownback feels this spending system needs to be changed; however, when it comes to energy policy, Brownback is there for his constituents. David Shankbone asked the Kansas Senator, a supporter of cellulosic ethanol, why he doesn't support the lowering of tariffs on sugar since sugar ethanol delivers 8 times the energy output of cellulosic ethanol. Brazil, in particular, has become energy independent because of its sugar ethanol program. It's cheaper to produce, and there is vastly more bang for the buck in sugar fuel than in corn fuel; an entire country no longer needs to import oil because of it. Federal tariffs currently make sugar ethanol too expensive in the United States. \"You're going to kill the ethanol industry here just as it gets going,\" was Senator Brownback's response. However, there is a debate over whether the process to make corn ethanol uses more energy than the ethanol itself produces.\n\nBelow is David Shankbone's interview with Senator Sam Brownback.\n\n----\n\nDavid Shankbone: Senator Brownback, how are you?\n\n:Sam Brownback: I'm fine; headed into Iowa. I’m doing a big event with Joe Biden tomorrow on a political solution in Iraq.\n\nDS: I read that.\n\n:SB: Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty excited about that. Maybe we can get some attention for a prospect that would really work.\n\nDS: Is it pretty gratifying for you to work with people on the other side of the aisle to try and find solutions?\n\n:SB: It is, because I think it defies what the country views Washington as being, which is as so hopelessly polarized that it can't get anything done. It shows some hope that even on tough issues like Iraq, we can get things done. So I think it gives some hope to the country, too, when we do things like that.\n\nDS: I remember sort of the old days where you'd hear about Ted Kennedy being best friends with Orrin Hatch; do you think that the Tom DeLay period ushered in an era where people were too opposed to each other on the sides of the aisle?\n\n:SB: Oh, I think we too often look for ways to fight, rather than ways to get along. And that's been a feature in recent years. Yeah, maybe that time is coming to a bit of an end as people have such low opinions of Congress and of politics, that maybe people will start finding these ways forward, and people will reward folks for doing that. We'll see. I don't know that the divisive period is over, but it does strike some interest in people when you do do it. Maybe we can.\n\nDS: Running for President has to be a grueling experience, and there must be a million things that you see out there when you're on the road that either you had not thought about before or you didn't know existed. Could you tell me about one?\n\n:SB: Well, you know, I just heard one. I was doing a big NPR interview with a group out of Boston, doing a call-in, and I had a couple of callers coming from the left in the political spectrum talking about their willingness to more engage in a discussion of faith and cut back on abortion. I thought it was very encouraging--and these are quite sincere people--part of what they're looking for in the Democratic party is more of a way forward on tough issues that have been divisive. I found that very encouraging.\n\nDS: That's great. Throughout my life, my father, who is an avid lifelong Republican, he used to tell me--this is a question that I'd asked Tom Tancredo as well, but I think it really comes down to one of the central issues in this race--he had said, \"All we need is a Republican Congress, a Republican Senate, and a Republican White House to get the country on the right track.\" And last year, he expressed to me that he was very disappointed with where things have gone with the Republicans running things. He feels let down; he feels like he was lied to by the Party, either through the rationale for the Iraq war, the sex and bribery scandals, the pork barrel projects, and, as Alan Greenspan said, the fiscal irresponsibility. He feels like there have been many broken promises. Why should someone like my father vote Republican today? And I can assure you he will. But why do you think he should?\n\n:SB: If he's looking for any of those issues to be addressed by the Democrats, they're not going to be. And I would hope he could also see that we've got two people on the Supreme Court now that are, we hope, pro-life votes to overturn Roe versus Wade, that he will see that pro-life legislation was passed, that taxes were cut. And what I would also say to him is that I think we also have to see that the system is built to spend. I hear from Republicans and Independents alike that the biggest thing they've been upset about, if you set aside opinions on the war, has been spending. And the system's just built to spend. Whether Republicans or Democrats are in control, you just constantly get that. I've said many times—I’ve represented Kansas since 1995--I have yet to have a single constituent come in my office and say, \"Hey, we're getting too much Federal money; would you please cut it?\" I get all the time people saying, \"Look, I'm a conservative, but we need this bridge, we need this subsidy, we need this hospital.” And the system's just built to spend. That's why you've gotta change the system, and I've been pushing aggressively, taking the BRAC military base closing commission process they'll use for military bases and applying it to the rest of government. So you've got an actual culling process that you're regularly requiring Congress to vote on. Because you've just got to change the system of its spending proclivities.\n\nDS: When you think about dropping out of the race, what emotions do you feel?\n\n:SB: Well, that presumes I'm taking that step, and what we're--\n\nDS: You've discussed it, and I'm just wondering when it's a thought that occurs to you-- not an inevitability---just when you think about it as a possibility, how do you feel when you reflect upon it?\n\n:SB: You know, what I've said is that if we don't finish fourth or better in Iowa that we'll pull out. And I think you just--if you look at it in that context, and I do, and this is a fabulous country, it's a great honor to be running for President, sharing big ideas with the country, and what a great place, that a guy can grow up on a farm in Eastern Kansas and run for President of the United States. I love a country like that.\n\nDS: Do you feel sad when you think about possibly leaving?\n\n:SB: No, I feel the great honor of putting ideas out there, and we continue to do it. We're giving a big speech on Sunday in Boston, and we're going to talk there about the expansion of the pro-life agenda, the need for racial reconciliation and an official apology for slavery and segregation....continuous talk about big ideas.\n\nDS: Evangelical candidates haven't fared particularly well in this primary season. What do you think is the reason for that?\n\n:SB: I don't know. I'm baffled by that myself. We haven't been able to raise money. But you would think we should be able to do that. If you look at both Mike Huckabee and myself in particular. I've had some difficulty based on the immigration issue, because I've supported a guest worker program. I think it's part of looking at every human as having dignity. We should try to enforce the laws, and we should enforce the laws and build a fence on the border, but at the same time see every person as a beautiful person created in the image of God, and that's been a very tough topic on our side of the aisle. Why we haven't gotten more traction, I don't know.\n\nDS: The Democrats often have concerns about the electability of their candidates; Hillary Clinton, for example. Do you think that it might scare some people that in this point in time that Evangelicals aren't particularly electable?\n\n:SB: Oh, I suppose it could be. I suppose it actually applies in reverse more, in that the reason why Rudy Giuliani is getting support is because of 9/11 and he is seen as the most likely person able to beat Hillary. I think it probably applies to that setting more than not seeing an Evangelical as electable, because George Bush I think would generally be seen in that category and was elected twice.\n\nDS: Do you think Mitt Romney's Mormonism is an issue that people should take into consideration?\n\n:SB: I don’t. There's no religious test for public office in this country. There shouldn't be. I think people should run on who they are and their record, and there I think he has a challenge, based on his record. But his faith should not be an issue.\n\nDS: What if someone was a Zoroastrian?\n\n:SB: Well, let's see what their policies are. Uhh--\n\nDS: Or a Satanist.\n\n:SB: Let's see what their policies are.\n\nDS: Really?\n\n:SB: There's not a religious test in this country, and let's see what their policies are.\n\nDS: Even though religious beliefs are so fundamental to a person? It's more of a policy issue than it is a faith issue?\n\n:SB: I think you'll see a person by what they produce, in their fruit, if you'll let me use that religious phrase. I think you'll know a person by their fruit. And that's what I think you'll see more coming through in people, and that that's what you should look for, and that's, I think, an observable--about how they live their own life, about what policies they advocate, about what are their priorities.\n\nDS: If someone told you that they were scared to vote for someone who doesn't believe in evolution, what would you say to that person?\n\n:SB: Well, I'd say to them that, for my part, I think most people agree that Man is not an accident, and that evolution is something that's taught in science class by state standards, they're not set by the Federal government, really shouldn't be something that would enter into their mind, not a Federal issue, it's one that's set by the states. I think most people that are concerned about evolution from a faith side want to see more taught about the science of how we got here, both at the very start--how did we get the initial cells, the initial biological entities, how did we get this incredible physics set up of this planet, universe that could have a carbon-based system here, all based on science. Just teaching science. And to teach more science, not less, on it. For me personally, I just have no doubt that God created us. How he did it, what mechanisms he used, I don't know. The fact that he did it, I have no doubt.\n\nDS: You don’t think that evolution is incompatible with an intelligent design theory? That we could have evolved based upon the evolution idea, but that it could have still been the work of God?\n\n:SB: There's some people that look at it that way. I think there's some--I think that's kind of an interesting way of looking at it. I don't--\n\nDS: What's your personal belief on that?\n\n:SB: I don't know. Just what I said--that I don't know how God did it. A number of people would in what you're describing a kind of, I don't know what you'd term it, a faith-based evolution or--that's not the term that some would call it.\n\nDS: It works.\n\n:SB: A guy at the Human Genome Project, Francis Collins, I've met with several times, I've read his book The Language of God, is in that category. And I find that very interesting. I think there's some rationality, too, when you look at the consistency of the genetic code between species, the different lengths, the different pieces that are in it, but there's a lot of the same genetic language that's there. Where I think we're really lost is we're segregating science and faith. And they ask and answer different questions. Science asks how, and faith asks why. And I think we'd be so much richer, and in societies in the past in Western civilization they did this a lot more, if you had the interaction of the two, of faith and science. Because these don't conflict. If they do, you need to either check your science or check your faith. But they conflict, and for most people's lives in the United States, they want somebody to strongly support science. And whatever we can do to understand better the cosmos and how we work and improve our lives. And yet it's a faith-based country. You have ninety percent of the country that believes in God. Most people, they don't see conflicts in this, and we would be so much richer if we had the discussion, rather than really trying to pit one against the other.\n\nDS: What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity?\n\n:SB: The lack of regard for life as being sacred I think would be my biggest threat to humanity.\n\nDS: What is the culture of life? How would you describe that phrase?\n\n:SB: It's seeing all life, at all places, at all stages as beautiful and unique, sacred, a child of a loving God. To me that's what a culture of life is, and us having walked away from that, we've had millions of abortions here, hundreds of millions around the world, people that should be here but are not.\n\nDS: Bobby Schindler, Terry Schiavo's brother, endorsed your candidacy by saying that \"Sam Brownback is the pro-life conservative we can trust to stand for all life, regardless of political calculations.\" Do you think the death penalty detracts from the culture of life?\n\n:SB: I do, and that's why I am not a supporter of a death penalty, other than in cases where we cannot protect the society and have other lives at stake. But again, I understand people who support the death penalty saying, \"This is different,\" whether it's an innocent human life or somebody that's committed a heinous crime. In trying to move forward with a culture of life, I think we need to try to do that in every setting, including the use of the death penalty by the State.\n\nDS: A common question I've asked in my interviews is about the Iraq War and how it has affected someone as a person. People often proffer their opinion on the war, but they don't really talk much about how it has affected them personally, perhaps in their world view. The writer Gay Talese insisted the war has not affected him at all. \"I wish it had,\" he said. Talese thinks there's a problem with Americans not sacrificing enough, and he argued that we need conscription. Do you think we need conscription, if not to support the manpower of the war, to make Americans more involved with the wars that we are fighting?\n\n:SB: Absolutely not. I'm absolutely opposed to conscription. The military opposes conscription; they want a voluntary force that signs up to be a part of the military, not people that are forced into it. And I don't think that's a necessarily right way to look at it, as far as that we need to feel more of the pain of the conflict. We're getting close to four thousand young people that we've lost. I think a lot of people know individuals personally that have been touched by this war in that most difficult way. I think it's impacted a lot of people in very strong and profound ways.\n\nDS: What you think the proper role of Congress is in a time of war?\n\n:SB: To declare it, which we did in the War Resolution on Iraq, is, I think, a proper role of Congress; to fund it, as we have been, and if people don't like the war, to stop the funding for the war. That's the role. I think there's an oversight role for Congress to play that can be very effective and helpful. I think there are suggestions that we can make, critical or complimentary in fashion, like what Joe Biden and I are doing on suggesting our political setup in Iraq is not working, and we think it should go another route. That ultimately has to be decided by the Iraqis, and not by us, but we can highlight these issues.\n\nDS: Do you feel the American people were misled with the war in Iraq?\n\n:SB: Based on the information we had at the time, I do not. On what we have found since, we have not found weapons of mass destruction. But the information we had at the time, from our intelligence service and from intelligence services overseas, was that they had weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological, and they were working on nuclear, and they had used them in the past, which we know they had--used them. There's also, I think, David, a real tendency, a decision made in 2003 through the eyes of 2007. In 2003, we're within two years of 9/11. The country is still in shock of what had happened at 9/11, and there was no way we were going to let somebody else, if we could stop it, get in a position to be able to use weapons of mass destruction, give them to terrorists, and come after us. And that seemed like an all-too-plausible scenario with Saddam Hussein having had weapons of mass destruction--we thought still had them. And having terrorists operate on this soil. We had a strong thought that he would mix the two against us. And we were not going to let that happen in light of that close proximity to 9/11. Now you go to 2007, you say, \"Well, that doesn't seem like a very highly likely scenario, but in 2003, it seemed an all-too-plausible scenario. And the first charge of the Federal government is to protect the people. When a bipartisan majority strongly voted to support the war in Iraq, it was with the thought of protecting the American people.\n\nDS: What do you think is going to happen to Egypt after Mubarak?\n\n:SB: It looks like now he's grooming his son, and they may well be able to pull off that succession. I would hope over a certain period of time they would get a more democratic, open economic system and that they would bring in people with the courage for that. I'm fearful of the Muslim Brotherhood taking over if there was an open election today in Egypt. It seems to me they have the upper hand in a general election in Egypt today.\n\nDS: Do you think it's a bad idea to have elections in countries if it's possible that an Islamic extremist group will win, such as happened in Palestine with Hamas?\n\n:SB: No, I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea, but I also don't think elections necessarily mean that you're going to have an open, free society, as we've seen taking place in the Palestinian authority and the activities of Hamas and now them even throwing out Fatah from the Gaza Strip, and this huge conflict that's taking place there. I think we're just gonna have to be a lot more real politic about this in the Middle East and the Muslim region of the world, about how far you can push and how hard you can push the governmental systems without just going into the radical Islamic fascist regime. One of the things I think we've gotta push a lot better, David, is to have the governments there provide services to the people, like health care and education, that are all too often being provided by these radical Islamic groups, so that people look more to the radical elements to meet their daily needs than the role that the government should be playing. I think that's bad for us. I think it's bad for the governments of those countries, and they need to do better about taking care of their own people.\n\nDS: Do you think that things like the Bridge to Nowhere are projects that shouldn't be funded? And I'm using that popular phrase--I realize it's a little emotionally charged--but things such as that.\n\n:SB: Yes, I agree that they shouldn't be funded. What I'd like to see is, again, you change the system. You require an authorization before you can get an appropriation, so I think that'll cut down more on those projects more than anything else.\n\nDS: You support the Elon plan that would essentially allow Israel to keep the entire West Bank while taking little responsibility for its Arab residents. The plan is against U.S., Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian policies. Why do you think that would advance peace in the Middle East?\n\n:SB: Well, at first, I didn't endorse the plan. We put out a statement yesterday on this; I think this is an interesting entry into a discussion that we haven't gotten very far at all with, this land-for-peace-type concept. It has not produced peace. I think what you're seeing in the Gaza Strip just further clarifies that. The Palestinian authority was given full control over this--what happened, you had Hamas run Fatah out in a gun battle. That's not a civil society. What I'm saying here is that it seems to me a good idea to look at a different model where you can get settlement of the Palestinian refugees and bring the Jordanians back into the picture on the West Bank, so you're not--you're looking more at a stable country like Jordan being involved, rather than trying to have the Palestinian authority take over when they've just shown no capacity to be able to govern. That's why I think this is an interesting way for us to look forward. I have not and I do not endorse the plan, but I do think we've gotta get different models on the table for discussion.\n\nSame-sex marriage\nDS: I interviewed the writer Augusten Burroughs. I would like you to answer a question that he posed. He said that \"God does not care that the person I watch TV with also has hairy arms, that the idea that a God would not like homosexuals is patently absurd, that it doesn't even begin to become logical in any way, that the idea that the architect of gravity, the being that created the ability for elemental particles that are absolutely nothing to come together and create living organisms and bricks and buildings and cars and jets, that the architect of absolutely everything would care about the sex of the person that this little human loves seems ridiculous.\" Why is that not ridiculous?\n\n:SB: I think He cares about everything. I don't know that everybody would take this as authoritative, but the Bible talks about a sparrow not falling without Him knowing that--He's numbered the hairs on your head, so that He cares about everything, and He's certainly a God of love-- He loves us very much. That's one of His central attributes, that He's a God of love, so I think He cares about everything and that there's nothing that would escape His view. We also have absolute free will to do as we see fit; we're not robots by any means. But I think He cares about everything.\n\nDS: Why do you think it would bother God that somebody is gay?\n\n:SB: Well, you're asking a theological question on something I'm just really probably not competent to answer. It usually gets asked in a context of the institution of marriage, and there, where I think the great need is for our society, is to uphold the institution as it has been, to recognize its great contribution to the raising of the next generation, and to see that more people, more of our next generation, is raised in a setting where you have a mom and a dad bonded together for life. The reason there is a State interest is that in all the social data--we know from all the social data that the best place to raise a child, is between a mom and a dad bonded together for life, that your highest percentage of children in that setting will get a good education, will generally get a good working environment, life—they’ll perform best. Now you can raise a good child in a single-parent family; you can raise a terrible child in a two-parent, stable setting. So things don't always work that way. But we do know from all the data that the best place for most is in that two-parent setting. When you redefine marriage--the countries that have done this, they've see their marriage rates go down, and the institution be weakened, and fewer children raised in that setting. That's why I think it's important to really stand for marriage being the union of a man and a woman.\n\nDS: In what country that has passed same-sex marriage has traditional marriage declined?\n\n:SB: The Netherlands--there's--Stanley Kurtz is the lead researcher on this. He's out at the Hoover Institute, and you see in--I've talked about when you pull the sacredness out of marriage, the marriage rates go down, you've seen this probably as pronounced as anywhere in a number of countries of Northern Europe, where you're now getting close to eighty percent out-of-wedlock birth rates on first children in some counties in Northern Europe. They've kind of gone from \"Well, we don't really need to be married; anybody, any two people can get married\"-you've just, you've taken the sacredness out of the institution. This is the work that I'm citing though, off of that.\n\nDS: Got you.\n\n:SB: But it's looking at the totality of--within the last forty years, it's a different societal view of marriage.\n\nDS: Why did you vote against the Federal expansion of hate crimes to include sexual orientation?\n\n:SB: Well, for a couple of reasons. One, it was in the defense bill, which I didn't think it was appropriate to be in there. Number two, it's a state issue. I think it's unconstitutional to put this out at the Federal level. For the Federal government to enact a crime, there has to be an interstate commerce nexus to it. Number three, the states are handling this well; the two cases cited--the Shephard case in Wyoming and the case in Texas, you've got the death penalty in one case and life imprisonment in the other. You can't get much harder on somebody there. And the final issue on this is that there's a substantial possibility of a chilling effect on free speech of people of religion--if there are ministers speaking from the pulpit on their view of homosexuality from a spiritual perspective.\n\nDS: Ministers speaking out against homosexuality would come under the province of a hate crime?\n\n:SB: A number of people believe strongly that it will. Those are a series of reasons why.\n\n*See also: Wikinews Interview with gay marriage movement founder Evan Wolfson\n\nDS: If you could choose your manner of death, how would you die?\n\n:SB: I hadn't thought much about that....\n\nDS: It's a Marcel Proust question.\n\n:SB: Gosh, I don't know. I more just--I want to be prepared to die, that I would pray at that point in time that I'm ready to meet my Maker, that I have a clean soul, that I've done what the Lord would have required of me and have lived as loving and caring a life as possible.\n\nDS: But you've never thought about how--if you could choose how you'd prefer to die?\n\n:SB: No, that's--\n\nDS: It seems like such a basic human thing to contemplate, one's mortality. I mean, I believe you, but--\n\n:SB: I've contemplated my mortality a lot. Because I had melanoma eleven years ago, and I thought a long time about my mortality. But what it did to me, it didn't make me think about how I wanted to die; it made me think about how I was living. And I just wasn’t happy with how I was living.\n\nDS: What weren't you happy with?\n\n:SB: I was too selfish; I was too ambition-driven. I was not paying near the attention to my family that I should have been. I was more interested in climbing the ladder, rather than helping people. And it really came around to me that if I were to die with this, I wouldn't have been happy with how I'd lived my life. And it just--it made my faith much stronger; it radically changed me, in looking at that.\n\nDS: That was your--\n\n:SB: I still get it wrong a lot. I am nowhere, anywhere near perfect. I am a sinful, fallen man, but my faith really drives me much more now, and I do a lot of things that before, I wouldn't have done. And I'm much happier with my life now than before that episode.\n\nDS: Was that your impetus to run for the Senate?\n\n:SB: No, but it did shape me, because it was just ahead of that run for the Senate that that episode happened.\n\nDS: What trait do you deplore in other people?\n\n:SB: I have too many of my own I deplore; it's hard for me to pick on somebody else.\n\nDS: Oh...\n\n:SB: I get judgmental quickly. I don't see, as I should, the image of God as much in others as I really want to. They're not traits in others that I deplore; it's ones in myself.\n\nEthanol fuel\nDS: Do you believe that a good Christian should also be a good environmentalist?\n\n:SB: Yes.\n\nDS: How so?\n\n:SB: Well, we're given the planet and given dominion over it, and I believe we should be good stewards of that. Now, the question becomes how do you do that, but I think the admonition to do that is God's creation, and we're the stewards of it. I think we clearly should be.\n\nDS: And you don’t think that Arctic drilling contradicts that notion?\n\n:SB: I don't think the ANWR drilling has been proscribed. We're talking about drilling in an area--I think the size is about ten miles by ten miles in an area that's the size of South Carolina. We do need resources to be able to continue to run--that our dependency on foreign oil generally favors some people who are--who do a lot of pretty bad things, out of Iran, or Venezuela, and that if we were less dependent upon that they would have less chance of doing some of the things they're doing. To me, I think you've got to look at it in a balance…I'd love to see us using a lot more electricity in our car fleet, reduce our dependence on oil drastically.\n\nDS: What about sugar ethanol?\n\n:SB: Sure. Sugarcane ethanol?\n\nDS: Do you think we should lower tariffs on sugar in order to be able to import more Brazilian sugar ethanol?\n\n:SB: You're gonna kill the ethanol industry here just as it gets going.\n\nDS: But it would reduce our dependency on foreign oil, thus increasing our national security, wouldn't it? Or is the ethanol industry here more important?\n\n:SB: Well, I think on the equation you're talking about, I think getting the ethanol industry here going--and particularly on cellulosic ethanol. And that's our big play to make here; we're--\n\nDS: But the energy that you derive from that is so much less than it is in sugar ethanol.\n\n:SB: I don't--you may be right on that. I've not looked at that energy ratio, but--it's a sound environmental way to go, on cellulosic ethanol, and that's, I think, the big play we need to be making and pushing aggressively towards in this country for energy independence and good environmentalism. I'm the lead Republican on a bipartisan bill that pushes this concept, and a big piece of it is getting plug-in cars on the marketplace than can do the first twenty or thirty miles off of electricity instead of either gasoline or ethanol, because half of the country doesn't drive over twenty or thirty miles a day. And that way, you can really drop your imported oil use quickly; it's good for the environment, too.\n\nDS: Senator, do you think that Wikipedia is important?\n\n:SB: Yes, a lot of people use it to get a quick kind of reference point review of a lot of different topics, including politics. And political figures.\n\nDS: Definitely. What do you find important about it?\n\n:SB: Just that. I mean, it's an easy access; it can be amended. I've not used it, but I've been with other people that have accessed it and know a lot of people that all say, \"Yeah, I looked it up on Wikipedia,\" so I know it's broadly and widely used.\n\nDS: I tried to get an interview with David Miscavige of the Church of Scientology, and I spoke to their Director of Public Relations; I had about a twenty-minute phone call with him, and he was very hostile to it. One of the things that I'd said to him--because he was saying that a lot of information is incorrect--I made the point to him that, \"You know, it may be incorrect, but the idea is that you can have Scientologists go on there to correct it.\" It's not a one-sided place for information; if you feel that there's inaccuracies, the idea is that you can also have people who know the truth go on there and correct it and debate about it, if that is what is necessary to get an accurate view. Whereas if you say something to Newsweek, and they print something that's incorrect, you're stuck.\n\n:SB: You're stuck, because that happened to us in Time magazine, and we got to do a nice letter to the editor that less than probably two percent of the people that read the big article saw. Wasn't fair that way. Hey, good to talk to you, David.\n\nDS: Very good to talk to you. Best of luck, Senator Brownback.\n\n:SB: Thank you. Bye.",

    "original_text": "Crime and lawEditorial journalist Roger Friedman has lost his job at Fox News following a dispute with the company. Friedman admitted in a movie review late last week to having wached a bootlegged online video stream version of a partially-completed copy of the upcoming film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, a Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation production. Friedman had worked for several years as a reviewer and media journalist for Fox News. While a press release from Fox says that the company and Friedman had \"mutually agreed to part ways immediately\", news articles report that he was fired.\n\nFriedman's status had been ambiguous after an April 5 statement from Fox that Friedman had been fired was met by a response from the journalist that no action had been taken against him.\n\nFriedman began his April 2 column, now removed from the Fox website, with: \"Yes, I've seen 'X Men Origins: Wolverine.' It wasn't at a screening, either. I found a work in progress print of it, 95 percent completed, on the internet last night. Let's hope by now it's gone.\" Friedman went on to praise the ease and convenience of downloading, noting that the current box office top 10 were all available. \"It's so much easier than going out in the rain!\", he wrote.\n\nIn an exclusive statement to Wikinews, Pirate Party International's spokesperson Andrew Norton said: \"Depending on the method he used to obtain the film, he may not have infringed copyright at all, just exercised legal fair use exceptions. When you add in the very positive review he gave the film, it makes you wonder why Fox acted as they did. The reason is painfully obvious, to 'send a message'. Alas the only message they send is that they don't care about facts, and let no-one stand in the way of their paranoid witch-hunt\".\n\nWebsite Ain't It Cool News editor \"Beaks\", meanwhile, responded to news of Fox's initial press release concerning Friedman's review on April 3 with \"Friedman has admitted to breaking the law. If 20th Century Fox—and the FBI—are serious about nailing the perpetrator(s) of this leak, then Friedman must be fired immediately for downloading and reviewing stolen material. There's no wiggle room here.\"\n\nThe positivity of Friedman's review had led some commentators, Ain't It Cool News among them, to speculate that the leak of the work print of the film had been a deliberate act by 20th Century Fox.\n\nThe full-length workprint of the film, lacking some special effects and ten minutes of footage shot after principal photography, was leaked on March 31, 2009. While 20th Century Fox adds digital forensic markings to its workprints to trace leaked versions, so far the company has not identified any party as responsible for the leak.\n\nX Men Origins: Wolverine, a prequel to the X-Men franchise of films, premieres in theaters in the United Kingdom on April 29, Australia and New Zealand on April 30, and the United States and Canada on May 1, 2009.",

    "original_text": "A report on May 10 by web analytics company WebSideStory estimates usage in the United States of Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE) web browser to have fallen to 88.9% by April 29, 2005, from 89.9% on February 18, 2005. Microsoft's strongest competitor, Mozilla Firefox, improved its market share from 5.7% to 6.8%.\n\nAll browsers based on Mozilla program code combined have a market share of 9%, while other browser alternatives combined make up a share of 2.1%.\n\nThe report also contains data from Germany and Japan. Firefox was found to have a much higher usage share in Germany (22.6%), and a lower one in Japan (2.8%), where Internet Explorer still holds 93.9% of the market.\n\nWhile Firefox's market share is still increasing in the United States, its growth has slowed down compared to a very rapid increase after its widely reported 1.0 release on November 9, 2004. Technology writer Paul Festa speculated in an editorial for Silicon.com that the decreasing growth rate \"could mean that the browser has converted a substantial proportion of its natural constituency, thought to be early adopters and the technically savvy.\" Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser developed by the non-profit Mozilla Foundation in collaboration with a team of volunteers.\n\nIn most countries, Microsoft's Internet Explorer has long enjoyed a market share above 90 percent. Many have attributed this to the browser's deep integration into the Microsoft Windows operating system.\n\nBrowser usage also varies strongly for different demographics. PC World, for example, reports only 67% of their visitors use IE.\n\nWhile Firefox's market share continues to increase, its growth rate has slowed and it may not reach its target of 10% overall market share by the end of 2005.\n\nPerhaps in response to inroads in a market it has dominated so heavily for many years, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates announced plans in February for a new release of the IE browser before the release of Windows Longhorn. The focus of the new release is improved security, which is much sought by users as IE is thought to be the vector of most security flaws in the Windows environment. Two new vulnerabilities have been reported within the past two months which affect Windows NT, 2000, and XP. \n\nMicrosoft's new release may be late, as some corporations are taking steps towards promoting Firefox as an alternative to Internet Explorer. CNET News reported on Thursday that technology giant IBM is encouraging its employees to use Firefox. IBM is also promoting other open-source technologies such as the free Linux operating system.",

However, he noted that the reason for the apparent engine failure had not yet been established.\n\nVan Vollenhoven said that the analysis of the aeroplane's flight data recorders could be finished as early as Tuesday, but added that the Dutch Safety Board would most likely not disclose any preliminary findings until next week.\n\nFred Sanders, a spokesman for the board, said that the damage to the aircraft corroborated witness accounts that the plane impacted with the ground tail-down.\n\n\"This may indicate that the plane had lost its forward momentum, that there was no motor function,\" he said, adding that it may be be a long time before a full explanation of the accident is available. \"We will have an official finding probably in about a year, but we should be able to give an interim finding within weeks,\" he said.\n\nNine people were killed and 86 injured on Wednesday when a Boeing 737-800 with 135 people on board registered to Turkish Airlines crashed just short of the runway in a farmer's field near Schiphol Airport.",

The Israeli government is to discuss a plan to allocate $46 million (&amp;euro;40 million) of funds to aid immigration by Jews in France, Belgium and Ukraine.\n\nMeeting with the Israeli Cabinet, Netanyahu said: \"Jews have been murdered again on European soil only because they were Jews and this wave of terrorist attacks – including murderous anti-Semitic attacks – is expected to continue... Jews deserve protection in every country but we say to Jews: Israel is your home. We are preparing and calling for the absorption of mass immigration from Europe. I would like to tell all European Jews and all Jews wherever they are: 'Israel is the home of every Jew.' ... Israel is waiting for you with open arms.\"\n\nThe Israeli economy minister Naftali Bennett backed up Netanyahu's statement: \"Israel is always waiting for them. This will never change. Jews can and should have the right to live anywhere, but if there are Jews who are concerned about their future, we are certainly waiting for them.\"\n\nIsraeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman stated the Danish attacks \"prove what we have said over the years – that Israel and the Jews are affected by this terrorism before anyone else because they are on the frontline in the war terror is waging against the West and the entire free world.\" He also said the international community needed \"to ask for more than declarations and demonstrations against this terrorism, but also shake off the rules of political correctness and fight a real all-out war against Islamic terror and its roots.\"\n\nDenmark's chief rabbi Jair Melchior said Netanyahu's comments \"disappointed\" him, and argued: \"Terror is not a reason to move to Israel. ... People from Denmark move to Israel because they love Israel, because of Zionism. If the way we deal with terror is to run somewhere else, we should all run to a deserted island.\"\n\nNetanyahu offered a similar statement following the attacks in Paris last month against the offices of Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket.",

    "original_text": "Lord Ram Source: WikipediaShiv Sagar, the grandson of a popular Indian TV and movie producer, is planning to build an infotainment theme park called Ganga-Dham on the banks of the Ganges River within the next two or three years. The project is expected to cost $6.4 million and one of the main investors is Alice Coltrane, wife of jazz great John Coltrane.\n\nThe family theme park, called \"Disneyland on the Ganges\" by the BBC News article, could probably be better compared to Disney's Epcot, since both feature an educational, interactive multimedia experience. Billed as the \"world's biggest-ever mythological theme park\", its purpose is to instruct the masses of Indian pilgrims who come to bathe in the Ganges with tales about the exploits of such Hindu gods as Rama, Vishnu, and Hanuman.\n\nThe focus is to be educational, not religious. \"We’re not doing this as a religious project,\" said Sagar to India-West in an interview last September. \"It’s not propaganda. We want to make it fun, a place where people can learn the Indian stories,\" a place that can appeal not only to Hindus but people of other religious faiths as well.\n\n\"The Hindu religion is well suited to something like this, religions like Islam are not allowed to depict forms but we have many different forms and representations of Gods,\" Sagar said in last week's BBC interview.\n\nThe name Ganga-Dham comes from the Indian words Ganga, for the Ganges, and Dham, meaning \"place\" or \"abode\". The park is to be built on 25 acres of land in the holy town of Haridwar, in the foothills of the Himalayas, where an estimated 18 million pilgrims a year come to ritually cleanse themselves in the river. The god Vishnu is said by legend to have left his footprint in the town.\n\nThe company behind this project is the Sagar Group. Shiv's grandfather Ramanand Sagar established a film company, Sagar Art, in 1950 and went on to make 25 films and some hugely popular serials for Indian television. Most notably, Sagar Art produced the groundbreaking TV mythological serial \"Ramayan\", about the Hindu god Rama. Starting in 1987, the series went on to attract worldwide attention and claim as many as 650 million viewers over a period of several years. Images and songs from their TV serials will be incorporated into the park to increase the popular draw and build on the tradition of reverence toward the Hindu gods that the series is known for.\n\nThe project has also attracted some criticism, by some who feel that the site next to the holy river Ganges is inappropriate for building, and others who do not appreciate the project's light-hearted take toward the Hindu pantheon, which they find disrespectful. However, an important hurdle has been cleared with the official support of the state government of Uttaranchal, and positive comments have been received from other interested parties who favor spreading the knowledge of Hindu philosophy by popular means.\n\nThere are other difficulties that still must be addressed, for example, a lack of infrastructure in the area to support tourism. But the Sagar Group stands to profit as they already have a Sagar Ganga Resort in the area.\n\nThe parts of the planned site, as described on the Sagar Group's website, are:\n\n* \"High-tech\" rides\n* Animated, interactive museum\n* Food courts and bazaar\n* Temple city\n* Petting zoo\n\nAlso places are to be provided for visiting non-resident Indians (NRIs) to set up \"remote poojas\" and other rituals over the Internet.\n\nConstruction is planned to begin later this year for completion by 2007, specifically timed to be ready for the major Kumbh Mela religious festival in 2010, which is expected to draw as many as 50 million or more visitors to the area.\n\nSome of the park proceeds are said to be set aside for various charities. If the park is successful, the Sagar Group plans to build similar Dhams around the world, in Asia, Oceania, South America, or perhaps even in places such as London, England; Los Angeles, California or Orlando, Florida in the United States.",

The recently proposed Internet Radio Equality Act, introduced by representatives Jay Inslee (D-WA) and Donald Manzullo (R-IL), would strive to revert the drastic changes applied to Internet radio royalties by the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) that will go into effect on May 15, 2007, and retroactive since January 1, 2006. The proposition aligns Internet broadcasting fees to be more inline with those of satellite radio, for a flat fee of 7.5% of the broadcaster's revenue, rather than the CRB rules of .08 (2006) to .19 (2010) cents per song for private broadcasters, or $500 per month for public broadcasters if below a specific number of listening hours.\n\nAccording to Inslee, the fees that would go into effect on May 15 would be a chokehold on democracy, and claimed in a statement that webmasters need a functioning business model.\n\nA common fear among Internet broadcasters is that they will have to file for bankruptcy once the fees of the CRB will go into effect. \"Over 90% of internet radio will simply be gone. The net result will be a huge loss of diversity, a huge loss for music artists and a loss of virtually all of the internet radio that exists,\" claimed Joe Kennedy, CEO of Pandora.\n\nSoundExchange, supportive of the CRB rules and a major collector of artist royalties from radio stations, has claimed the new fees are necessary to pay the artists that deserve it.",

Over 500 were hurt in the attacks, which were the worst to strike the country in over two years.\n\nThe attacks occurred at the Justice Ministry building and a provincial government office close to the high-security Green Zone part of the city. The explosions came during rush hour, at 10.30 local time (07.30 UTC).\n\nOfficials have warned that the death toll is likely to rise, as rescue workers are still searching underneath the rubble of collapsed buildings to find more bodies.\n\nSources gave conflicting reports as to whether suicide bombers were involved in the attacks, or whether the bombs had been detonated remotely. According to the police, cars loaded with explosives had been parked in garages close to the targeted buildings.\n\nSo many people were wounded in the blasts that private cars helped ambulances transport bodies to local hospitals. Rescue efforts were hindered by the heavy rush hour traffic. The buildings targeted by the bombings caught fire, and officials had to close down roads nearby as fire trucks tried to quell the flames.\n\nYasmeen Afdhal, 24, who works for the Baghdad provincial administration, was a witness to one of the bombings. He described his experiences: \"the walls collapsed and we had to run out. There are many wounded, and I saw them being taken away. They were pulling victims out of the rubble, and rushing them to ambulances.\"\n\nIraqi council member Mohammed al-Rubaiey said that about 25 staff members of the Baghdad Provincial Council, which runs the country's capital, died in the bombings.\n\nHamid Saadi, the owner of a shop near the blast, told the news agency Reuters that the explosion caused significant destruction. \"The explosion destroyed everything ... it's like it was an earthquake, nothing is still in its place,\" he said.\n\nA reporter for the BBC said that the force of the blast was so strong that it could be felt for several miles away.\n\nPrime Minister Nouri Maliki accused al-Qaeda of being behind the bombings. \"These cowardly terrorist attacks must not affect the determination of the Iraqi people to continue their struggle against the remnants of the dismantled regime and al-Qaeda terrorists, who committed a brutal crime against civilians,\" he said in a statement. \"They want to cause chaos in the nation, hinder the political process and prevent the parliamentary election.\"\n\nThe attacks come ahead of planned elections, which are to be held next January. The authorities have warned that more such attacks could take place by rebels wishing to destabilise Iraq.\n\nWhile violence in the country has dropped substantially since the height of sectarian fighting, the attacks were the second major security breach in Baghdad - a city filled with checkpoints - in two months. Twin bombings in August of this year struck another two government buildings, killing about 100 people.",

The actor had told relatives he wanted his ashes blasted into outer space, as was done for \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry. \"He'll be there with his buddy, which is wonderful,\" said Doohan's agent and longtime friend, Steve Stevens.\n\nAt the time of his death, he was living in Redmond, Washington in the United States with his wife and their three young children.\n\nDoohan was born in Vancouver and participated in World War II as a captain in the Royal Canadian Artillery.

Doohan was among the film's greatest supporters, thanking the director for not sanitizing the gore of the actual event.\n\nHe started his acting career with a radio appearance at a CBC show and went on to act in several character roles. Doohan had already made a name for himself in the entertainment business as a featured voice actor in Canadian and U.S. radio dramas and motion picture voice-overs due to his knack for picking up linguistically perfect accents. His ability to affect a near-perfect Scottish accent made him a natural for the role of Scotty, according to producers at the time.\n\nWhen he auditioned for what would become the role of his life in 1966, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry asked him which of the different accents Doohan mastered would best suit the role of Scotty. Doohan respond that he believed \"all the world's best engineers have been Scottish\". After the original Star Trek series had ended, Doohan found himself typecast and had difficulties getting other roles.\n\nDoohan suffered from Parkinson's as well as Alzheimer's disease. In August last year he received a star on Hollywood's Walk of fame.\n\nAfter DeForest Kelley, Doohan is the second actor of the original Star Trek cast to die.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Wende, with whom he had been married since 1975, and seven children.",

    "original_text": "wikileaks\nSunday night's release of leaked United States diplomatic cables shows widespread concern in the Arab world over Iran's ambitions to build a \"Persian Empire in the 21st Century\".\n\nWikileaks, so far, have released under 300 of the quarter million plus diplomatic communications posted to them on a memory stick. The small sample shows, over several months, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Bahrain asserting that further sanctions against Iran will likely have no effect.\n\nEarly November last year, General David Petraeus discussed the situation with King Hamad of Bahrain, who argued for the use of force to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions; stating: \"The danger of letting it go on is greater than the danger of stopping it.\"\n\nIn that meeting concern was expressed that more Arab involvement in Iraq was needed to frustrate Iranian plans. Petraeus was told Bahrain sought Egyptians and Saudis support, but talks with the latter revealed no interest in taking a leading rôle.\n\nThe King did welcome the prospect of India becoming involved in the region as a stabilising influence.\n\nA mid-December meeting between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the UAE and US Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman saw the subject brought up again. In a discussion that touched on the two countries renewable energy plans, and reliable movement of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, the Prince asserted Iran saw itself as spearheading a campaign for a \"Persian Empire in the 21st Century.\" Alleging Iran has established \"emirates\" in Kuwait, Bahrain, Eastern Saudi Arabia, Southern Iraq, Yemen, and South Lebanon, his picture of Iranian nuclear ambitions is \"Al-Qaeda is not going to get a nuclear bomb; Iran is a matter of time.\"\nMap of the Strait of Homuz.\nThe Prince was keen to stress that those in power are the same people who, in 1979, seized the US embassy in Tehran.\n\nSubsequent talks between a congressional appropriations sub-committee and UAE's Foreign Minister were the scene of equally serious predictions. The sub-committee, consisting of Nita Lowey, Tom Cole, Barbara Lee, and Donna Edwards, heard from Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan that if Iran became a nuclear state the rest of the region would likely follow suit.\n\nPlans to keep the fifteen-millions-plus barrels of oil passing through the Strait of Hormuz each day moving were discussed. Whilst keen to weaken Iranian ties with China, Sheikh Abdullah stressed the US$50 billion in trade between the two; this being considered an obstacle to China backing, and enforcing, a stronger sanctions regime.\n\nThe sub-committee's Emirates host, like many in the region, stated progress on the Israeli peace process was a good route to de-escalation.\n\nA meeting in February this year with Kuwaiti Interior Minister Jaber Al-Khaled Al Sabah was the scene of comparable warnings. Alongside discussions on travel restrictions to be enforced against former Guantanamo Bay detainees, he described Iran as the \"beating heart\" of Islamic Extremism.\n\nConcerns over Iran's involvement in Yemen were discussed, with the minister saying Iran is intent on exporting its revolution; that its nuclear ambitions can only be thwarted by force.\n\nUpdating the US on perceived Iranian actions, he claimed they were attempting to infiltrate Egypt by recruiting the poor. And, they were becoming involved in the drugs trade, shipping narcotics into Yemen to fund militants.\n\nThe cable on the Kuwait meeting closes referring recipients to a wiki page: http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Kuwait. Wikinews has been informed this is a page on the US intelligence community's Intellipedia; an internally-maintained project, based on the same technology as Wikipedia, and intended for use in building intelligence dossiers on countries, regions, their politicians, diplomats, plus political and terrorist groups.\n\nA cable originating in London from January this year is corroborated by later U.S. news reports; hinting that the Iranian government may indeed be using tactics more reminiscent of the cold-war.\n\nIn the opening weeks of the year, London-based Voice of America commentator Ali Reza Nourizadeh was advised that Mohammed Reza Sadeqinia intended to target him for assassination, along with others. Sadeqinia was previously arrested in California, and prosecuted for attempting to hire a hit man. The target at that time was reported to be Iranian-American broadcaster Jamshid Sharmahd, one of the main figures behind Tondar &amp;mdash; a loose collection of in-exile Iranians opposed to the current regime.\n\nTehran insists Tondar is a terrorist organisation, accusing it of being responsible for a 2008 bombing that killed 14.\n\nSadeqinia, who worked as a painter in Ann Arbour, was arrested on July 28, 2009 near Los Angeles International Airport in possession of thousands of dollars and an Iranian passport. FBI investigations into his possible Iranian government ties were still ongoing a month before his scheduled release in July this year.\n\nFound guilty by Los Angeles Superior Court of attempting to hire someone to murder Sharmahd, he had been expected to spend around a year in jail. Tondar spokesman Iman Afar, in the lead up to Sedeqina's release, expressed concern for his own safety and that of others in the L.A. area.",

Matt Whitton and Rick Dyer say that they were hunting for the creature in the forests of Northeastern Georgia in the United States when they came across the corpse of one of the alleged animals.\n\nAfter finding the body, Whitton and Dyer allegedly took it home, where it is currently being stored in a freezer. Despite the possibility of the historic find, they will not say where they found the body.\n\n\"We have no intentions of revealing the location. We want to protect this creature,\" stated Whitton during the press conference. He also mentioned that an autopsy is going to be conducted on the body.\n\nThe two men had earlier claimed that DNA evidence, photos and video would be presented during the conference, but only one photo was shown. Whitton states that all evidence will be provided once the autopsy, scheduled for next week, is completed.\n\nThe single photo shown at the conference portrays a blurred black figure in the distance. Whitton claims the creature was walking \"parallel\" to them as they hauled out the corpse. Another photo on Whitton's website www.searchingforbigfoot.com shows what is allegedly the corpse, decapitated and stuffed into a freezer.\n\nTom Biscardi, founder of the Great American Bigfoot Research Organization, joined Whitton and Dyer at the press conference. Biscardi has previously been caught in a hoax. In 2005, his organization claimed to have caught a live male Bigfoot.\n\nScience website LiveScience, run by Imaginova, openly speculates that this is a hoax because of the involvement of Biscardi. It theorizes that this may be a marketing scheme to promote an upcoming film by Biscardi, entitled Bigfoot Lives.\n\nAt least one other person states that the group's pronouncement is a hoax. Jerry Parrino, owner of TheHorrorDome.com, a website that sells Halloween costumes, was quoted as saying to Fox News that the photo appeared to resemble a costume that is being sold on his site.\n\n\"It definitely looks like our costume. This body has little to do with Bigfoot and everything to do with a Sasquatch costume that someone developed,\" stated Parrino.\n\nDespite the claim, the Fish and Wildlife Reserve refuses to investigate the alleged discovery because it does not appear on an endangered species list in either the state of Georgia or the U.S..",

The petition levelled allegations against the Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, of having maintained influence over Shin Corporation and been involved in the decision to sell the family's remaining stake in the company to Temasek Holdings, the investment arm of the Singapore Government.\n\nThe court's decision to reject the petition seeking impeachment was reached following an 8-6 vote. The submitting senators were said not to have provided evidence documenting Thaksin's interest in Shin Corp. or how he was involved in the sale. This is despite a former judge from the Constitutional Court endorsing an opinion shared by some senators and academics that the court was bound by law and precedent to review the allegations.\n\nThe president of the Federation for Democracy, Weng Tojitrakarn expressed disappointment at the court's decision not to review the petition, stating that \"It's the duty of the court to seek evidences\". He pledged that his group would press for the resignation of the eight judges who supported the Prime Minister.\n\nAccording to Weng an interview with the Prime Minister's son, Panthongtae Shinawatra, reveals Thaksin's involvement in the sale. Panthongtae is said to have claimed the sale was a matter for \"puyai\", which Weng interprets as meaning Thaksin.\n\nThis is not the first time that Thailand's beleaguered PM has faced judgement from the court, nor may it be the last. In 2001 the court acquitted Thaksin by an even closer 8-7 vote. The charge in that case was concealment of assets. A new petition being organised by students of Thammasat University calling for impeachment has reportedly reached 20,000 of the 50,000 required signatures.\n\nFurther controversy over the PM's family's involvement in Shin Corp. was revealed in a Thai News Agency report. According to the Secretary-General of the country's Securities and Exchange Commission the PM's son and daughter may face fines for failure to report their shareholding in Shin. Other issues relating to Shin Corp. are also under investigation by the SEC with collection of evidence and documentation expected to be complete within a week.",

Already, two businesses, Skunk Tail Glass and Six Nations Native American Gift Shop have relocated, outside the Elmwood Strip. Don apparel, H.O.D. Tattoo and Mondo Video still remain on Elmwood; however, Mondo Video is planning on moving to a new location. The hotel will be 72 rooms and will cost at least 7 million dollars to build.\n\n\"We're lovers, not fighters. Our energies should be spent on developing a really wonderful project, not wasted in court. We'll start over with a clean slate and take as much time as necessary to hear people out and end up with a very positive project for the neighborhood,\" said President of Savarino Construction, Sam Savarino.\n\nThe hotel will not undergo any major changes in its design says Savarino. \"We would anticipate little if any physical change to the plans.\" He also alleges that the issues with the hotel were not with the design or the proposal and also says that the hotel is still right for the intersection.\n\n\"The perceived problem was with the process, not the proposal itself. We believe this is the right thing to do on that corner,\" added Savarino.\n\nAccording to the Buffalo News, the projects resubmission is aimed to \"shed the lawsuits\" against the proposal. The Buffalo News also claims that the Common Council members are all still \"in favor of the project.\" The proposal was unanimously passed by the council on March 21, 2006.\n\nAttorney Arthur J. Giacalone who represents the plaintiffs, Nancy Pollina and Patricia Morris, who operate Don Apparel (a vintage clothing and collectibles shop at 1119 Elmwood Avenue), Angeline Genovese and Evelyn Bencinich, owners of residences on Granger Place which abut the rear of the proposed site, Nina Freudenheim, a resident of nearby Penhurst Park, and Sandra Girage, the owner of a two-family residence on Forest Avenue less than a hundred feet from the proposed hotel's sole entrance and exit driveway, says that the hotel proposal was \"inappropriately rushed,\" but some council members disagree. Defendants in the lawsuit against the hotel are, Buffalo's Common Council and Planning Board, Mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown, Savarino Construction Services Corporation, Hans J. Mobius and his son Hans S. Mobius owners of the properties at stake, Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, and Cendant Corporation, the parent company of Wyndham Hotels, which will be, according to Savarino, the hotel operator. Attorney David State is representing the city, Planning Board, Mayor Byron Brown and the Common Council.\n\n\"I don't think it was a rush job,\" said Dominic J. Bonifacio Jr., the council's Majority Leader.\nHe also alleges that the only way to make \"it the hotel a better project and ease the concerns of some neighbors would be to find a way to provide more parking.\"\n\nIn an exclusive phone interview with Wikinews, Giacalone states that the lawsuit against the hotel and the city \"will not be moved withdrawn unless the Common Council resins their prior decisions in passing the proposal.\" Giacalone also says that Savarino has yet to submit any new plans for the proposal to the city. He also says that he \"still plans to represent all plaintiffs\" if they wish to continue with the suit and the use of his services.\n\nGiacalone rescheduled the preliminary hearing which is \"still in place\" for July 27, 2006. When asked if the properties are still owned by Mobius, Giacalone replied \"yes\" and that according to attorney Bob Knoer, the Lawyer representing Hans Mobius, the owner of the properties that could be demolished, there is \"no contract between Savarino\" and that Mobius \"plans to put the properties back on the market.\" Mobius has not returned phone calls or e-mails and has not yet commented on the situation or the proposal itself. The city denies these claims. \nIn an exclusive phone interview by Wikinews, area councilman Joseph Golombek states that the reason for the resubmission of the proposal was due to \"a mistake in the Planning process\" and that none of the council members have \"indicated that they have changed their opinions on the hotel\" and still remain in favor of the project.\n\n\"I still think the Hotel is a good idea for that part of Elmwood. For Elmwood to stay strong and vibrant it must continue to grow and adapt to change. It is a different community than it was twenty years ago and will be different in another twenty years. The opponents of the Hotel\nhave the opportunity to challenge it and are doing that. Even though I disagree with them I am glad there is a safety mechanism for people who disagree with government. We need to keep moving forward,\" added Golombek.\n\nSupporters of the hotel proposal are planning on holding a rally to support the new development. WNYmedia.net claims that the first rally will be held to support the hotel proposal on July 17, 2006 at 5:00 p.m. on Elmwood and Forest, on the site of the proposed location. According to WNYmedia.net they \"are tired of the anti development crowd in Western New York.\" They also blast opponents of the hotel proposal calling them \"bananas\" and \"nimbys.\" People opposed to the hotel proposal are planning on \"counter attacking\" with their own protest on the same day and time.",

It says that 57% of people had their home completely destroyed by the cyclone, whilst only 2% of people had no damage to their home.\n\nOn May 9, the United Nations requested $187 million in aid for Myanmar, but this figure has increased as the full extent of the damage has been revealed. The amount of donations were several times bigger than the requested amount. By 15 June, around 12 billion kyat, or two billion dollars in donations had already been received by the government of Myanmar, according to the report.",

Officials of both organizations have assigned a low but real risk to the possibility of an outbreak. No-one has actually become infected.\n\nAccording to WHO, the virus was sent to laboratories in Belgium, Bermuda, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Japan, Lebanon, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States.

A fifth soldier was wounded. Following standard procedure, the identities of those killed have been withheld pending notification of relatives.\n\nThe milestone was reached just days after the fifth anniversary of the start of the war on March 19, 2003 when the United States and the United Kingdom invaded Iraq \"to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people.\" However, no weapons of mass destruction have been located yet.\n\nA military spokesman, Navy Lt. Patrick Evans, gave condolences to the family and noted each death is \"equally tragic.\" Evans also added, \"There have been some significant gains. However, this enemy is resilient and will not give up, nor will we. There's still a lot of work to be done.\"\n\nThe U.S. military says that in 2007, 901 soldiers and personnel were killed, which made that year the deadliest year for U.S. troops since the beginning of the war.\n\nThis occurred on the same day when Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the current Iraqi National Security Advisor said that \"This war is well worth fighting,\" on CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer.\n\n4=Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Iraqi National Security Advisor\n\"This is global terrorism hitting everywhere and they have chosen Iraq to be a battlefield. And we have to take them on. If we don't prevail, if we don't succeed in this war, then we are doomed forever,\" al-Rubaie stated. He further added, \"I understand and sympathize with the mothers, with the widows, with the children who have lost their beloved ones in this country. But honestly, it is well worth fighting and well worth investing the money and the treasure and the sweat and the tears in Iraq.\"\n\nAlso on the same day, various separate attacks by Iraqi insurgents caused in total 40 deaths of Iraqi civilians. In Baghdad, mortars or rockets were fired into the high-security \"Green Zone.\" Meanwhile, a suicide bomber killed six people in Shula, one Baghdad's Shia neighborhoods. Also, gunmen in seven cars open fired in a mixed neighborhood of Baghdad killing seven people.\n\nMeanwhile, 13 Iraqi soldiers were killed at an army base by a suicide truck bomber and another four were killed by a roadside bomb in Tuz Khurmato.\n\nThe death toll of Iraqi civilians is estimated to be around 80,000 to 150,000 or more. However, the true death toll is unknown as the United States military does not keep records of civilian deaths.",

    "original_text": "Thousands of residents are evacuating coastal areas of far north Queensland (QLD), set to be lashed by Cyclone Larry tomorrow morning. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology warns that the \"very destructive core of Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry, with extreme gusts up to 280 km/hr (174 mph) should cross the coast between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. AEST on Monday (Sunday, 2100 to 2300 UTC). Destructive winds are expected to commence along the coast between Ingham and Port Douglas. Gales are already being experienced along the exposed coast in the warning area.\"\n\nTropical Cyclone Larry, currently building off far north Queensland, is expected to intensify before crossing the coast. Queensland tropical cyclone warning centre spokesman Bruce Gunn says people should treat warnings very seriously. \"This is the worst cyclone we have had for many, many years,\" he said.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) says the cyclone poses a \"very serious threat to life and property\" and will now post warnings on the hour on its website.\n\nThe BOM also warns coastal residents between Cairns and Townsville of dangerous storm tide when the cyclone crosses the coast. The bureau says the sea is likely to steadily rise up to a level which will be significantly above the normal tide, with damaging waves, strong currents and flooding of low-lying areas extending some way inland. People living in those areas should be prepared to evacuate if advised by authorities.\n\nMandatory evacuations have been enforced in low-lying seafront areas, including in the Johnstone and Cardwell shires south of Cairns, which are expected to bear the force of Larry and its four metre storm surge.\n\nDisaster coordination centres have been activated in Cairns and Townsville. \"There have been mandatory evacuations of coastal shires south of Cairns ... and emergency shelters set up for people who feel at risk with nowhere to go,\" said a Cairns City Council Disaster Coordination Centre spokesman. \"It's most likely thousands of people are evacuating to avoid the high tide.\"\n\nPremier Peter Beattie has issued a disaster declaration. Local governments now have the power to enforce mandatory evacuations. Queensland Education Department announced that schools in the hardest hit areas will be closed tomorrow, while flights to Townsville and Cairns have been cancelled.\n\nState Emergency Service (SES) volunteers are doorknocking and advising residents to leave. Bruce Gunn from the Queensland cyclone warning centre says the cyclone will coincide with a high tide. \"We are talking seawater a couple of metres above the high-tide mark, possibly more than that, with waves on top, so this is a very serious situation we are talking about,\" he said.\n\nMr Gunn told the ABC that severe weather will be experienced several hours before the cyclone reaches the coast. \"While we are saying the coastal crossing will be between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. AEST, the few hours leading up to that will be rather bumpy — not very nice to experience,\" he said.\n\n2006-03-19",

Next year's fuel bill is going up by €400m. We only have around 10% hedged in the high $70s for next year and I wouldn't be hedging now.

UBS predicts a profit of €485m for this year, but O'Leary says profits could be down to €235m between now and March 2009, dependent on \"oil prices and average fares\". In light of the news, shares in Ryanair fell 2¾ cents to €2.96½ each.\n\nRyanair is trying hard to reduce costs, O'Leary saying they were \"renegotiating airport contracts, handling contracts, maintenance contracts. We Ryanair want to reduce costs in every area of our operation.\" He said prices for passengers are set to go up, as \"bag charges will keep going up until we can persuade half of our passengers to travel without checked-in luggage so we can get our handling charges down\". At present, around 40% do this.\n\nHe said that to fill an extra 30% of seats the airline will keep fares relatively low. \"We won't have to cut the fares like hell but they are not going to go up...

The loss of the Boeing 737 killed all 121 people on board in what was the deadliest air disaster for both Greece and Cyprus.\n\n\"The charge sheet was submitted to the court Nicosia today Tuesday, and a response to the charges has been set for February 26,\" said deputy attorney general Akis Papasavvas. The names of those charged were not released, and they face charges of manslaughter and causing death by a reckless, thoughtless or dangerous act, which carry life and four year terms respectively. They all worked for Helios.\n\n\"The charges concern two of the three most serious offences under the Cyprus penal code,\" said Papasavvas. Families of the victims, who had already called for criminal prosecutions, are still carrying out a civil action against the Cypriot civil aviation authority and airframer Boeing. Helios closed in 2006, having been renamed Ajet Airways.\n\nThe unresponsive aircraft, supposed to be flying between Lanarca to Prague, entered Greek airspace, where it was intercepted by two F-16 fighter jets on August 14, 2005.\n\nThe F-16 pilots reported the airliner's pilots were slumped over the controls. After flying on autopilot for two hours the aircraft crashed near Athens despite the efforts of a flight attendant, who was training to become a pilot, to take control and save the jet.\n\nThe subsequent investigation discovered that the pilots failed to adequately monitor the pressurisation system. The plane lost cabin pressure and hypoxia caused the incapacitation of the passengers and flight crew. It is thought that the conscious flight attendant had used multiple crew oxygen cylinders to outlast the others on board. Investigators also believe that the equipment had been left in the wrong setting after testing by maintenance engineers and never checked before flight.\n\nAfter failing to resuscitate the pilot-in-command, the trainee pilot turned off the autopilot and attempted an emergency landing at Athens International Airport, which the aircraft had been circling in a holding pattern awaiting human input. However, the aircraft ran out of fuel before reaching the runway.",

The group was protesting the proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill, calling upon Premier Iemma not to support the laws. The protest was organised by the New South Wales Greens and was addressed by several speakers, including Lee Rhiannon, an elected Greens parliamentarian from the New South Wales Legislative Council.\n\nOne protester carried a placard which read: \"Terrorism Laws=Fascism!\" She compared the proposed legislation to the 1933 German Enabling Act, saying \"It is the most basic rule of democracy is that you have the right to legal representation and Hitler took that away, that was Habeas corpus as it was called, in 1933 legislation and from that moment on thats when everything began. They could remove people, anyone who objected anyone who was a witness, anyone who tried to find out what happened could also be removed.\"\n\n\"John Howard's terror law would not make Australia safer\", Lee Rhiannon said in her speech, \"They will not stop a London style bombing occurring in Australia and that's what we need to remember. This is another one of John Howards's lies. Let's remember weapons of mass destruction, (and) children overboard.\"\n\nThe Australian government introduced anti-terror laws after September 11, and has sought to extend those laws in the wake of the London train bombings.\n\nThe government claimed in a media release today that it has this week received specific information about a terrorist threat to Australia.\n\n\"The Government has received specific intelligence and police information this week which gives cause for serious concern about a potential terrorist threat. The detail of this intelligence has been provided to the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Minister for Homeland Security,\" the release said.\n\nThe government claims that the new bill is intended to improve the ability of intelligence services and the police to counter this threat.\n\n\"The Government is satisfied on the advice provided to it that the immediate passage of this bill would strengthen the capacity of law enforcement agencies to effectively respond to this threat,\" the release said.\n\nDr Andrew Lynch, Project Director of the Terrorism and Law project at the Gilbert &amp; Tobin Centre of Public Law, has said that Rhiannon has raised some valid issues regarding some of the provisions in the proposed legislation.\n\n\"It is difficult to see how many of the provisions will enhance our security. For example, the bans on free speech will only drive inciting and hateful messages under ground which must make the job of security forces harder in identifying real threats. The restrictions on family members knowing about the detention of their children is not conceivably going to improve our safety. There is a lot to be said for the view that depriving people of their liberty on the basis only of 'reasonable suspicion' might well fuel feelings of alienation amongst some groups which could be harnessed by extremists,\" Dr Lynch said.",

A orthodox seminary student took the note and gave it to Israeli newspaper, Maariv. Obama is on an international tour to strengthen his foreign affairs credentials ahead of the November election.\n\nJewish clergy and others have expressed dismay at this personal violation of privacy. Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who is the supervisor of the Western Wall, told Israel Army Radio that it was a \"outrage\", and that \"The notes placed between the stones of the Western Wall are between a person and his maker. It is forbidden to read them or make any use of them.\"\n\nAnalyst and director of the Orthodox Am Ehad think tank, Jonathan Rosenblum said, \"It's inappropriate that the prayers of a person at the Western Wall should become a subject of public knowledge at all.\"\n\n\"There is a rabbinic prohibition against reading other people's private communications, and certainly anyone who goes to the wall expects that those communication will be protected,\" Rosenblum added.\n\nMaariv has drawn significant criticism for the publication of the prayer. Other Israeli media have chosen to not publish the letter to respect Obama's privacy while many media sources outside Israel have printed the note or excerpts of it.\n\nIn the note, Obama did not pray for success in his election but rather prayed for protection for his family and forgiveness. The note ended with Obama asking for God to \"help me guard against pride and despair. Give me the wisdom to do what is right and just. And make me an instrument of your will.\"\n\nThe Western Wall, often referred to as the Wailing Wall, is the lone remaining outer retaining wall of the second Jewish temple and is considered to be Judaism's holiest site. The temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 was constructed on the same mountain ridge where King Solomon built the first Jewish Temple in the 10th century BC, which was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. According to classical Jewish belief, the Temple (or the Temple Mount) acts as the figurative \"footstool\" of God's presence in the physical world.",

    "original_text": "Australian news\nElection 2007\nWith Australian Prime Minister, John Howard and Labor leader Kevin Rudd facing off in a leader's debate on Sunday night, political analysts and body language experts declared Mr Rudd the clear victor. Experts said that Mr Rudd came across as believable and enthusiastic while Mr Howard appeared too negative.\n\nThe focus of the debate was on the economy, Iraq war, leadership and climate change.\n\nOn the economy, the Labor leader said that the cost of living had increased in Australia and that increasing the childcare rebate to 50 percent would help struggling families.\n\n\"That's putting several thousand dollars extra into the family budget,\" he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister tried to reassure voters on industrial relations, one of the key topics of the election, saying that despite his WorkChoices legislation being controversial it has largely achieved what the government aimed it to do. \"Our whole design with WorkChoices was to underpin further growth in the Australian economy. It wasn't easy. It was heavily criticised, but the general evidence is WorkChoices has been good for the Australian economy,\" said the Prime Minister.\n\nMr Howard also ruled out making further changes to Australia's industrial relations system saying that the government had \"gone far enough\".\n\nMr Howard also dismissed claims that his planned AU$34 billion of tax cuts would cause inflation and a rise in interest rates.\n\n\"They will dampen wage demands that might otherwise be much stronger because of those cost of living pressures,\" he said.\n\nThe leaders debated over who the genuine economic conservative was. Mr Howard said that Mr Rudd's voting record in parliament seemed to contradict his claim. The Prime Minister warned that a Labor government would run budget deficits. \"Being an economic conservative is more than a slogan in a TV advertisement, it is believing in things,\" he said.\n\n\"Everyone knows Labor governments equal budget deficits and Liberal governments mean budget surpluses.\"\n\nMr Rudd said there was now consensus between both sides of politics on economic issues and took the opportunity to remind voters of Mr Howard's performance as treasurer in the Fraser government of the late 1970s to early 1980s. Mr Rudd said that the prime minister was a treasurer at a time of high interest rates and ran four out of five budgets with deficits. \"Let's have some honesty on the table here. Let's get the record straight,\" said Rudd.\n\nMr Howard dismissed his record attacking Labor's record of interest rates in the 1980s under Bob Hawke. \"There is one interest rate figure that is seared in the memory of most Australian families - the level of 17 per cent,\" he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister attacked the Opposition's front bench saying that there were far too many former union members. Mr Rudd hit back by saying that Mr Howard's frontbench was disproportionate in its make up. \"If something's out of whack in terms of an unrepresentative group in the community, a cocktail of lawyers and former Liberal Party staffers would have to be high up the list,\" he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister also used the forum to announce new climate change initiatives and an update of the role Australia is playing in Iraq. Mr Howard promised that low-income earners would be compensated for the \"inevitable\" rise in costs for electricity that moving to cleaner production would bring. By comparison the Labor leader reiterated his support for the Kyoto protocol and promised to ratify it if elected.\n\nMr Howard said that Australian commanders in Iraq would this week start discussing taking on a broader training role in Iraq to help train Iraqi soldiers.\n\nRudd questioned Howard on the shift of policies in Iraq and asked the Prime Minister why Australians should believe him after ruling out an increase in troop numbers before the last election, only to double them when elected. The comments sparked an argument between the two leaders with Mr Howard accusing Mr Rudd of involving the military in politics.\n\n\"You chose to use it in a very political fashion. I was providing some information to the Australian people and I was pointing out the evolving nature of the commitment of our ground forces in Iraq,\" said Howard.",

    "original_text": "2020 United States presidential election\n\nThe following is the sixth and final edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\n\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail: the Free and Equal Elections Foundation holds two presidential debates, three candidates who did not participate in those debates give their final pleas to voters, and three political pundits give their predictions on the outcome of the election.\n\nPolls at the start of the final full month on the campaign trail showed Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump, the Republican Party presidential nominee, in the RealClearPolitics average, 50.1 to 42.9 percent.\n\nOctober started with a surprise for the electorate. After it was revealed his aide Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus, President Trump himself, his wife Melania, and son Barron all tested positive for the virus. Trump was said to be suffering \"minor symptoms\", and was admitted to Walter Reed Hospital as a precaution. Video captured Trump wearing a mask while walking to Marine One en route to the hospital. Doctors reportedly treated the president with a cocktail of medicines that included an experimental drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as well as the anti-viral remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone. His condition was said to be improving and he posted a four minute long video from the hospital. Supporters gathered outside and Trump made a much-criticized ride to wave at them from the presidential limousine. After a three day stay, Trump was released from the hospital and returned to the White House. He tweeted, \"Don't be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life.\" A couple days after Trump’s release, the only vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris took place in Utah, moderated by USA Today Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page. Pence often spoke over his allotted time and interjected. In one exchange, as Pence attempted to interrupt, Harris exclaimed, \"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking.\" A fly landed on Pence's hair for about two minutes. Page received criticism for not asking follow-up questions. Politico regarded the debate as \"markedly more civil\" than the prior Trump-Biden debate. The next day, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced its second official presidential debate between Trump and Biden would be virtual due to President Trump's positive COVID-19 test. Trump declined such an arrangement and the Commission canceled the debate. In its place, Biden scheduled a town hall to air on ABC. Trump later scheduled a competing town hall on NBC.\n\nWith the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett looming, the issue of Court packing returned. Biden and Harris both refused to answer whether they would support Court packing. Biden said voters \"don't deserve\" to know his position. A few days later, Biden made another frank comment when he claimed 56 percent of respondents to a Gallup poll, who regarded their personal situation as better now than four years ago, were not remembering correctly, adding people should vote, whatever their beliefs. Still recovering from coronavirus, Trump gave his first speech since the diagnosis from the White House balcony. Trump's doctors said the President no longer posed a risk of spreading the virus. Two days later, he returned to the campaign trail with a rally in Sanford, Florida. At the rally, Trump declared himself \"immune\" and offered to kiss members of the crowd. White House doctors said Trump tested negative for COVID-19 for two consecutive days.\n\nIn another potential \"October surprise,\" on the week of Trump and Biden's dueling town halls, the New York Post published an article about the discovery of a laptop belonging to Biden's son Hunter that he allegedly abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop. According to the Post, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon told them of its existence and current Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City, recently gave them a copy of its harddrive's contents allegedly obtained from the shop owner. E-mails in the copy detailed Hunter's worldwide business affairs and alleged influence peddling. Contrary to the elder Biden's assurances he had no involvement in his son's business deals, an e-mail alluded to a 2015 meeting between the elder Biden and a Ukranian adviser to the board of the energy company Burisma, on which Hunter served. The report claimed after the meeting the elder Biden used his influence as vice president to have a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma fired. The material also contained a video of Hunter smoking crack cocaine and taking part in a sex act. Fifty former intelligence officials, including former CIA directors John Brennan, Leon Panetta, and Michael Hayden, signed a letter saying the Post'&amp;zwj;s report \"has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\" Current Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said the information was \"not part of some Russian disinformation campaign.\" According to The Washington Post, intelligence officials warned the administration last December that Giuliani could be a conduit for Russian disinformation. Twitter prevented users from sharing the Post story, claiming it violated their policy on hacked materials. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey later said they made a mistake. Facebook did not censor the story but limited its spread on their platform. Shortly after the report, Trump and Biden held the dueling town halls on NBC and ABC, respectively. While NBC simulcast Trump's hour long town hall, hosted by Savannah Guthrie, on the main network as well as MSNBC and CNBC, ABC broadcast Biden's town hall with George Stephanopoulos for two hours. The broadcast of Biden's event received more viewers than Trump's event. At his town hall, which newspaper The Hill described as combative, Trump refused to disavow the Qanon conspiracy theory and defended his pandemic policies. At Biden's event, Biden implied he would consider making a potential COVID-19 vaccine mandatory. On Court packing, he said his decision would depend on how the Senate conducts the Barrett confirmation hearing.\n\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates announced the moderator for the third debate would have a mute button to prevent interruptions during the first two minute candidate responses with each question. Biden left the campaign trail to prepare for the debate. Trump did minimal preparation, holding rallies instead. At this time, he made critical remarks about National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci and posted footage on Twitter from a soon-to-be released 60 Minutes interview with Leslie Stahl, that Trump claimed was unfair. Trump's previous debate prepper Giuliani received further media scrutiny when he appeared in the Borat Subsequent Moviefilm. In a scene, Giuliani goes into a hotel bedroom, where a hidden camera records him lying on a bed with his hands in his pants in the company of a young actress posing as a conservative journalist. Giuliani claimed he was tucking in his shirt after removing his microphone and suggested Borat actor and producer Sacha Baron Cohen may have deceptively edited the footage. Giuliani received news concerning the laptop harddrive data in his possession: Fox News reported two separate law enforcement sources confirmed an FBI money laundering probe connected to the laptop. Additionally, Ratcliffe and FBI director Christopher Wray held a press conference discussing concerns about Iranian and Russian interference in the election. Ratcliffe claimed Iran spoofed e-mails to spread false information about voting to hurt President Trump's chances of re-election. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon predicted Trump would run for president again in 2024 if he lost in 2020. Democrats continued to attack Trump on his taxes. Senator Bernie Sanders slammed Trump for a New York Times story alleging Trump paid more taxes to the Chinese and other governments than to the United States.\n\nJust before the final presidential debate, Hunter Biden's former business partner Tony Bobulinski held a press conference claiming Joe Biden knew about his son's business deals, particularly with China, and that the elder Biden was involved with them. He claimed to have evidence supporting the claim. The issue came up at the Nashville, Tennessee-set second presidential debate, moderated by Kristen Welker of NBC News. Biden denied the allegations, labeled them as Russian disinformation. Echoing an email from Hunter Biden's laptop referencing a mysterious \"big guy\" who received a cut of money, Trump said, \"You're the big man, I think.\" Trump attacked Biden for accumulating wealth since leaving public office, accusing the Biden family of going around the world and sucking up money like a vacuum. Biden slammed Trump, viewing the president as having no plan to combat COVID-19. Trump said he banned travel from China in January, which Biden opposed as xenophobic. He claimed a vaccine was near and said people are \"learning to live\" with the virus. Biden countered that people are instead \"learning to die\" with it. Biden argued that Trump had no healthcare plan. He proposed a public option and claimed nobody lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare. Trump alleged Biden's plan would strip Medicare and Social Security. He vowed to protect people with pre-existing conditions from being denied health coverage. When asked about climate change, Trump claimed carbon emissions have been lower during his administration and argued against re-entering the Paris Climate Accord. Biden argued that green energy can provide good paying jobs. Trump accused Biden of previously saying he wanted to ban hydraulic fracturing. Biden denied, though Trump said it is on tape. Biden asked Trump to post the video on his website. Welker brought up the separation of immigrant families at the border. Trump point out the Obama administration constructed the cages seen in widely circulated photos taken in 2014. Trump blasted Biden as a career politician and repeatedly asked why Biden did not already implement the policies he proposed. Biden attacked Trump on paying fewer taxes to which Trump claimed he prepaid \"millions of dollars\" in taxes. Trump cornered Biden on oil and gas when Biden admitted wanting to phase out the industry. Trump said Biden just lost Texas, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Ohio as a consequence. Welker received near-universal praise for her performance. Observers noted the debate was more orderly than the first.\n\nIn the final days of October, Trump ramped up his campaign, holding up to five rallies a day throughout such states as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Arizona, and Florida, among others. Biden limited campaigning but still made stops in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, and others. Due to COVID-19, attendees to Biden events were required to socially distance or to stay in their automobiles with horns in the place of applause. At one Biden rally in Pennsylvania, Trump supporters audibly chanted slogans nearby. Biden referred to the people as \"chumps.\" At another in Minnesota, Biden referred to hecklers as \"ugly folks.\" Meanwhile, a series of news events broke as Election Day drew closer. The Senate confirmed judge Barrett to the Supreme Court. Justice Clarence Thomas swore her in at a White House ceremony with Trump looking on. The White House also announced a deal it brokered to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel. This followed deals the administration brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kosovo, in recent months. The fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., a mentally ill African American man armed with a knife, sparked riots and looting in Philadelphia. Biden-Harris released a statement: \"we cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death.\" President Trump called it a \"terrible event\" but urged for the National Guard to be brought in to end the violence. Category Two Hurricane Zeta slammed into the Louisiana coast. Winds from the storm delayed a rally Trump planned for North Carolina. The anonymous insider who wrote New York Times op-eds and a book critical of the Trump administration was revealed to be former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor. The Trump campaign described Taylor as \"just another standard-issue arrogant, Washington, DC swamp bro who loved President Trump until he figured out he could try to make money by attacking him\". The Commerce department released a report showing growth in GDP of 33.1 percent in the third quarter of 2020. This was the largest growth for the nation in a quarter since World War II, topping the record of 16.7 percent in the first quarter of 1950. Trump hailed the report on Twitter and warned that Biden could destroy the growth with his proposed tax increases. Biden described the growth as not \"nearly enough.\"\n\nAt the end of October, President Trump trailed former Vice President Biden in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head matchup, 51.3 to 43.5 percent.\n\nThe Free and Equal Elections Foundation held two debates in October, attracting third party and independent candidates. The criterion for inclusion was ballot access in at least eight states.  The two major party candidates qualified but were barred from participating due to the contracts they signed with the Commission on Presidential Debates.   Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente, and rapper Kanye West were each invited but did not attend.  Those who did take part in-person were: Independent presidential candidate Brock Pierce, Green Party presidential nominee Howie Hawkins, Constitution Party presidential nominee Don Blankenship, American Solidarity Party presidential nominee Brian Carroll, and Party for Socialism and Liberation presidential nominee Gloria La Riva.  All of these candidates also confirmed for the final debate, but Blankenship ultimately decided not to attend. Free and Equal Elections Foundation founder and director Christina Tobin moderated both debates. This was the fourth election cycle the foundation has held a debate.  The debates used the format the League of Women voters developed when  they held the official presidential debates before the creation of the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nAt the initial debate, held October 8 in Denver, Colorado, after opening statements, the candidates received a total of 13 questions on the War in Afghanistan, approval and rank choice voting, national debate reform, the surveillance state, space warfare, indigenous rights, police reform, education reform, Yemen, the War on Drugs, vaccinations, gun rights, and excessive imprisonment. Questioners included Tobin, anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, Aaron Hamlin of The Center for Election Science, Eli Beckerman of Open the Debates, actor Sean Stone, SpaceX co-founder Jim Cantrell, indigenous leader Doug Good Feather, and the mother of prisoner  Ross Ulbricht.  The debate closed with final statements from each candidate.\n\nIn opening the debate, Carroll introduced himself as \"pro-life\" and said climate change must be addressed.  Pierce derided the two party system and argued it cannot resolve the nation's problems. La Riva blamed capitalism as the root of all the nation's ills.  Blankenship offered US$1 million to Hunter Biden to have a debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and made the same offer available to President Donald Trump. And Hawkins, the only candidate wearing a facemask, endorsed the Green New Deal and the Economic Bill of Rights.\n\nThe candidates agreed on many issues with varied nuances. All supported the removal of US troops from Afghanistan though Pierce and Carroll raised concerns about the problems that  could arise from a hasty withdrawal.  While La Riva and Hawkins attacked war as a tool of the US ruling class, Blankenship wanted the US to avoid being the policeman of the world.  Blankenship described efforts toward approval or rank choice voting as too complicated and \"diluting\" efforts toward ballot access. All the other candidates favored rank choice voting.  La Riva favored offering voting rights to documented and undocumented immigrants, prisoners, and youths aged 16 to 18 years.  Most candidates felt the League of Women Voters did a better job holding debates than the Commission on Presidential Debates, agreeing the sponsor should be nonpartisan. Pierce commented on the unfairness of \"rigged polls\" excluding third party candidates. Blankenship attacked the media for maintaining the status quo, providing an example of the media falsely describing him as a \"felon\" ahead of the 2018 West Virginia Republican Senate primary. Blankenship favored expanding space exploration, arguing the US should be at the lead rather than some other nation. La Riva criticized any space agency as militaristic.  Most candidates agreed to the need of an international body to regulate space. On Police reform, Blankenship and Carroll expressed opposition to Defund the Police while La Riva fully endorsed it, Hawkins expressed an interest in community control of the police, and Pierce focused on providing further training for officers.  Pierce and Carroll endorsed charter schools, though Carroll expressed concerns about for-profit schools. Hawkins said many charter schools were scams.  La Riva said she fully opposed charter schools. Pierce called for an end to the War on Drugs, with which Hawkins and La Riva somewhat agreed. La Riva agreed and favored prosecuting banks for providing funds and said legalization would not be helpful, cautioning about the dangers of pharmaceuticals. Hawkins called for the decriminalization of drugs like Portugal but felt those exploiting others should be prosecuted. He favored providing medical access for addicts. Blankenship opposed ending the War on Drugs but said those at the top should be prosecuting rather than users.  Carroll agreed and cautioned about the effect of cannabis use on the brain. La Riva, Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all agreed that vaccines have done more good than harm. Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all argued they should not be mandatory. Pierce said he would not take a vaccine for COVID-19, claiming it alters the recipient's RNA and turns them into \"genetically modified humans.\"  Carroll and La Riva disagreed about whether a clinic in San Francisco was selling the body parts of aborted fetuses.  La Riva said she fully supports abortion rights.  On the issue of guns, Pierce expressed concern about the number of US citizens purchasing guns and warned of an impending civil war.\n\nIn closing, Pierce urged voters to \"vote their conscience.\" La Riva argued that only socialism can bring about equality to the nation.  Blankenship claimed he was the only candidate on the stage who based his platform on the US Constitution and called for the use of cost-benefit analysis for policy.  Hawkins predicted President Trump would lose in a massive landslide and asked voters to vote for what they truly believe. Carroll demanded the protection of human dignity and support for the family as society's basic unit.\n\nAt the final debate held October 24 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, after opening statements, the candidates received ten questions on fairness in debates, veteran suicides, military propaganda, centralized control of technology, national sovereignty, the primary system, rank choice voting, ballot access laws, regulation of artificial intelligence, and the national debt. Chad  Peace of the Independent Voters Network, antiwar activist Adam Kokesh, Brian Anderson of Nexus, conspiracy theorist G. Edward Griffin, Kaia Los Huertos of the National Association of Nonpartisan Reformers, Renaldo Pearson of RepresentUS, Richard Winger of Ballot Access News, and Tobin, each asked questions. Like the previous, the debate concluded with final statements from the candidates.\n\nWith Blankenship's absence, only four candidates took the stage.  In opening, La Riva called for an end to the capitalist system, and the cancellation of all rents and mortgages.  Pierce professed himself \"deeply concerned\" about the future of the US and endorsed using \"life\", \"liberty\", and \"happiness\" as the measure of success.  Hawkins renewed his support for the Green New Deal and an Economic Bill of Rights, and added a call for the abolition of nuclear weapons.  He noted that the doomsday clock is very close to midnight. Carroll argued that the US has the strength necessary to overcome all the problems it faces.  He found it curious he was called a \"Democratic socialist\" in one publication and yet received the endorsement of a writer for The American Conservative.\n\nLike the previous debate, there was much agreement among the candidates. Pierce and Hawkins both argued for using ballot access as an inclusion standard for debates.  La Riva disagreed, stating that the Electoral College should be eliminated. She criticized the Top Two election policy in California and called for the Citizens United decision to be overturned. Carroll also backed the overturn of Citizens United.  Hawkins attacked the \"macho culture\" that idolizes the military while it fights to protect the interests of the upper class. Carroll recalled someone who went to fight in the Vietnam War and returned changed. He wondered how the US can train people to be racist killers and then expect them to return to society. La Riva described the military as a \"horrible\" use of the working class.  She called the Korean War a \"genocidal war.\"  Pierce then explained he was an honorary ambassador in Korea. He longed for the reopening of the border between North and South Korea.  Pierce emphasized big tech censorship as a problem more than military propaganda. He argued that tech companies should either decide to be publishers or platforms. La Riva regarded technology under capitalism as problematic but said it would be beneficial under socialism. Pierce countered that technology is amoral and can be good or bad based on how it is used.  Hawkins argued that big tech is moving the nation in a democratic socialist direction.  Carroll argued for checks and balances for big tech and for a new level of government to regulate big tech.  La Riva then called for the expropriation of big tech companies and to let the US people decide how to use the parts.  Concerning national sovereignty, Pierce said he favored treaties over war and endorsed an audit of the Federal Reserve.  Hawkins called for the nationalization of the Federal Reserve and expressed concern about the nation losing its sovereignty to corporations rather than other nations. La Riva agreed with the nationalization of the Federal Reserve.  Carroll argued that trade deals like NAFTA have unforeseen consequences like pushing Mexican corn growers north of the border. Carroll also said he wanted to edit the 14th Amendment to remove corporations from its protection.  Whereas Pierce and Hawkins all felt parties should decide the procedures for their own primaries, La Riva favored the open primary system, arguing it is more democratic than Top Two.  Pierce claimed Abraham Lincoln was the last third party candidate to be elected president and that he appointed a cabinet of rivals.  Pierce said he was embarrassed about the questions politicians asked to tech leaders, and argued the nation needs \"visionary leadership.\"  La Riva argued against Universal Basic Income (UBI), proposing minimum wage be increased to US$20 an hour.  Carroll agreed with La Riva, saying that jobs are more important than UBI.  He named his economic view as distributism, which he said was an extreme form of capitalism.  Hawkins claimed that as a currency issuers rather than a currency user, the US government has enough money to spend and that the debt and deficit does not matter. La Riva agreed, claiming there was enough wealth in the nation to pay for everyone's needs. Carroll called on the US to end its involvement in foreign wars worldwide and to stop paying for wars on a credit card.  Pierce viewed the debt as an issue and that government has run out of control and tax reform is necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, Carroll explained that he is pro-life on all issues. He supported social justice and considered strong local  communities, strong small businesses, and strong families as fundamental. La Riva argued socialism is growing in popularity and private ownership is the real tyranny people live under.  Pierce emphasized the need for education across the nation and likened the current system to indoctrination.  Hawkins claimed the coronavirus pandemic shows the US is a \"failed state.\"  He urged voters to vote for what they want.\n\nWikinews provided an opportunity for three presidential candidates who did not participate in either of the Free and Equal Election debates to give their final plea to voters.  Those giving their final pleas are: Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, Prohibition Party presidential nominee Phil Collins, and Unity Party of America presidential nominee Bill Hammons.\n\nFile:Jo_Jorgensen_portrait_1_(crop_1).jpg|Jo JorgensenJo Jorgensen for President\nFile:PhilCollins.webp|Phil CollinsProhibition Party\nFile:Bill-Hammons-head-shot-president (Wikinews).jpg|Bill HammonsBill Hammons\n\nI'm counting on my libertarian and independent base because they know that I'm the real deal.\n\nTo dissatisfied Democrats stuck with a candidate who voted for more war and who wrote some of our most oppressive criminal justice laws, I say, \"There is a real party of peace and justice.\" The party that selects the author of draconian incarceration and a prosecutor who locked up thousands for victimless crime does not deserve your vote. To them, I say, \"Be Bold. Vote Gold.\"\n\nTo small-government Republicans who've watched out-of-control spending and fiat money creation, who rightly fear Venezuela-style inflation and economic collapse, I say, \"There is a real party of smaller government and individual responsibility.\" We can unshackle the market to create prosperity and opportunity, and we can reduce government by 75% without leaving anyone out in the cold. To fiscal conservatives, I say, \"Be Bold. Vote Gold.\"\n\nMy final plea is telling voters that I remind people about the harmful effects of alcohol. I tell them that we care about other issues. We support a balanced budget. We're pro-life and pro-gun rights.\n\nIt is highly possible that this election will be the first to be thrown to the House of Representatives in the modern era. The 12th Amendment outlines that the top three finishers in the Electoral College receive consideration for a House vote, and I would just need a handful of (or perhaps even just one) Electoral Vote(s) to be in the final running alongside two men who, not to put too fine a point on it, are walking National Security risks considering their health, age, and risk factors for a raging COVID-19 Pandemic. I ask voters to vote their conscience, because Presidential Electors are people too, and enough Hammons votes might convince enough Electors to also vote their conscience.\n\nWikinews asked three political pundits to give their predictions for the Electoral college tally of the 2020 presidential election. The pundits were: former U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo, who represented Colorado's 6th congressional district as a Republican; political blogger Thomas Knapp, who founded the Boston Tea Party; and attorney Ron Gunzburger, founder and publisher of the elections website Politics1.com.\n\nFile:Tom Tancredo, official Congressional photo cropped.jpg|Tom Tancredo US Congress\nFile:Tomknapp.jpg|Thomas Knapp Avens O'Brien\nFile:RonGunzburger.jpg|Ron Gunzburger Ron Gunzburger\n\nIn addition to his time in Congress, Tancredo ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination. During his run he spoke to Wikinews in an exclusive interview. Afterwards, Tancredo ran for Governor of Colorado in 2010 as the nominee of the Constitution Party, finishing the race in second place. He later returned to the Republican Party.\n\nTancredo predicts President Trump wins re-election over former Vice President Biden with an electoral count of 362 to 176.\n\nIn 2008, Knapp stood as the first vice presidential nominee of the Boston Tea Party, which disbanded in 2012. Historian Darcy Richardson picked Knapp as his running mate for his 2016 campaign for the Reform Party's presidential nomination. Knapp runs the politics blog KN@PPSTER and is the director and senior news analyst of The William Lloyd Garrison Center for Libertarian Advocacy Journalism.\n\nKnapp predicts former Vice President Biden defeats President Trump with an electoral count of 319 to 219.\n\nGunzburger, a trial lawyer since 1988, founded the nonpartisan Politics1.com in 1997. He currently serves as senior advisor to Maryland's Republican Governor Larry Hogan. According to Twitter, he describes himself as a centrist Democrat.\n\nGunzburger predicts former Vice President Biden defeats President Trump with an electoral count of 359 to 179.",

    "original_text": "culture and entertainment\n\nPoland yesterday announced the purchase of the Czartoryski art collection for about €100million (US$105m; £85m). It is worth an estimated €2billion.\n\nAmongst the roughly 86,000 artworks is Lady with an Ermine by Leonardo da Vinci. Lady with an Ermine alone is thought to be worth more than the government paid for the full collection; it is insured, the government said, for about €330m. Also included are around 250,000 books and other texts.\n\nAdam Karol Czartoryski, representing his family, as head of the Czartoryski Foundation owning the collection, negotiated the sale with the Ministry of Culture. Czartoryski \"felt like making a donation\" and was entitled to, he said. The Czartoryski Foundation's board resigned in protest. The board said they were not consulted and disapproved of the price.\n\nThe current Law and Justice government was reported in national press as prepared to part with up to a billion zloty (US$235 million) to acquire the foundation. Culture Minister Piotr Glinski said \"It is a fraction of the market price of the collection\".\n\nLaw and Justice, who gained power a year ago, had expressed interest in acquiring the works, housed in Krakow and on public display. The government is running a nationalisation programme for cultural items and major companies.\n\nPurchasing the Czartoryski collection required a state budget amendment and, according to the Ministry of Culture, months of talks. The move \"ensures the right of the Polish nation to the collection,\" said Glinski.\n\nThe collection was assembled over the course of more than 200 years. It also features Landscape with the Good Samaritan by Rembrandt and works by French artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir.\n\nLady with an Ermine, from 1490, is one of four known da Vinci portraits of women. Stolen during Nazi rule, it was recovered and returned. It features Cecilia Gallerani, mistress to Duke of Milan Ludovico 'The White Ermine' Sforza. Sforza's nickname explains the titular creature painted in Gallerani's arms, which was added to the painting by da Vinci; an earlier, painted-over version does not have it.",

    "original_text": "The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is increasing faster than expected, according to a new study published in Tuesday's edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study said that rising levels of CO2, the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change, threaten to accelerate global warming. The study attributes the change in CO2 levels to increased use of fossil fuels and a decline in the amount of gas being absorbed by the oceans and land.\n\nCO2 emissions have increased by an average of 3.3 percent per year since 2000, compared with 1.1 percent per year in the 1990s. The rate has increased 35 percent more than scientists had anticipated based on economic growth, according to Corinne Le Quere, one of the paper's authors.\n\n\"The causes of the acceleration are surprising,\" Le Quere said. \"One is that we are not as efficient at using CO2 as we had anticipated, and the second cause is that it appears that the CO2 sinks are weakening.\" The main natural CO2 sinks are the oceans and plants.\n\nThe study attributed approximately half of the unexpected growth to an increase in the carbon intensity of the global economy, a measure of the amount of carbon emissions per unit of economic activity. \"For 30 years we were becoming more efficient at using CO2 for producing energy and wealth, and this has completely stalled since 2000,\" Le Quere said, adding that increased use of coal by developing countries such as China and India was partially to blame.\n\nThe remaining unexpected growth was attributed to a decline in the ability of the oceans and land to absorb CO2. Most climate models do not account for a weakening of CO2 sinks, Le Quere said. Alan Robock, associate director of the Center for Environmental Prediction at Rutgers University, called the reduction of the oceanic CO2 sink \"really shocking\".\n\nThe study \"raises some very important issues that the public should be aware of: Namely that concentrations of CO2 are increasing at much higher rates than previously expected and this is in spite of the Kyoto Protocol that is designed to hold them down in western countries,\" said Kevin Trenberth, the head of the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a lead author of the 2007 assessment report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nThe IPCC predicted in February of this year that temperatures would rise by up to 6.4 degrees Celsius over the next century. However, Le Quere suggested that this scenario might be overly optimistic. \"There’s quite a significant difference from what was forecast,” she said. \"It’s rather scary and the IPCC scenarios are, therefore, rather too optimistic — as if they weren’t bleak enough already. The whole thing is likely to mean mitigation is rather more difficult than was thought.\"",

    "original_text": "Monday evening was the 800th episode of WWE Raw, although not as celebrated as last year's 750th \"Raw Family Reunion\" episode, it was \"business as usual\" for the show, pushing towards the WWE No Mercy pay-per-view in two weeks.\n\nThe show opened with WWE World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho coming to the ring and climbing atop a tall ladder where the WWE World Heavyweight Championship belt was hanging overhead. Chris Jericho will face current antagonist Shawn Michaels in a Ladder Match for the championship at the pay-per-view. Jericho talked about the fact that while fans applauded Michaels' remarks regarding his accomplishments in ladder matches fans have forgotten that Jericho has won three championship titles in ladder matches, and has participated in more high-profile ladder matches than Michaels. This would draw out former champion Randy Orton, who has been injured with a shoulder injury for the last three months. Orton on a tear criticizing current and former champions as well as top contenders as to their worthiness of holding the title, and Chris Jericho was no exception. Just as it looked like Jericho was ready to pummel Orton, Orton declared that WWE Raw General Manager Mike Adamle made a new proclamation that anybody who attacked Orton would be suspended indefinitely.\n\nJericho withdrew from the ring, but was immediately replaced by CM Punk, a man Orton attacked a few weeks ago, costing him the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in a four-way match at the WWE Unforgiven pay-per-view. Punk and Orton would come nose-to-nose before Punk slapped Orton in the face, sending him reeling to the corner. General manager Mike Adamle came out along with acting on-air representative Shane McMahon. Together they diffused the situation between Punk and Orton, and announce the main event match, champion Chris Jericho and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield against Shawn Michaels and Dave Batista.\n\nBefore that main event happened, Jericho would talk with Mike Adamle in his office, speculating that the reason Shane McMahon was at the show was to test Adamle's skills as a leader rather than a company yes-man, and that rather than following Mr. McMahon's directions to the letter, that he should use them as a suggestion for his own ideas. This would result in the main event becoming a three-on-two match, with the addition of Lance Cade to the team of Jericho and Layfield. Cade, a former protégé for Shawn Michaels and current ally of Jericho, played a major factor in the match. Cade's presence in the ring was a distraction to Shawn Michaels, who spent the majority of the match fighting off double-team efforts and cut off from making a tag to his partner. Dave Batista would eventually make that tag, but would be quickly overpowered by Jericho and Layfield. Michaels would tag in one last time while Batista would continue to fight outside of the ring with Layfield. Michaels appeared to have Cade defeated, but a distraction by Jericho allowed Cade to recover and attack Michaels from behind, pinning him after executing a sit-out powerbomb.\n\nFull match results for the evening:\n* CM Punk def. WWE World Tag Team Champion Cody Rhodes by pinfall;\n* WWE Intercontinental Champion Santino Marella def. Deuce Shade by pinfall in a non-title match;\n* Kane def. Evan Bourne by pinfall;\n* Kelly Kelly def. WWE Women's Champion Beth Phoenix by pinfall in a non-title match;\n* Mike Mizain &amp; John Morrizon def.

    "original_text": "Israel\nOn Monday, online rental firm Airbnb announced its intent to remove housing listings in Israeli West Bank settlements. The decision would likely affect about 200 properties within the coming days.\n\nAirbnb said they made the decision because of the controversy surrounding the settlements, describing them as \"at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians\".\n\nThe company stated: \"US law permits companies like Airbnb to engage in business in these territories. At the same time, many in the global community have stated that companies should not do business here because they believe companies should not profit on lands where people have been displaced\".\n\nVarious human rights activists and Palestinian officials, critics of Airbnb's West Bank listings for several years, lauded the announcement. Israeli leaders criticized the company and supported bringing legal action against it in US courts.\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Tourism said they would act to limit Airbnb's activity within the country. The office's minister Yariv Levin also ordered the creation of a program aimed at boosting West Bank settlement tourism and accommodations.\n\nUnder international law, disputed by Israel, Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are illegal. The settlements have been a major obstacle in peace negotiations for the region. About 600 thousand Israeli settlers populate West Bank and East Jerusalem Israeli settlements.",

    "original_text": "In a result predicted by polls, a 54.87% majority of French voters voted non in Sunday's European Constitution referendum. Of France's 42 million eligible voters, over 70% turned out at the 55 thousand polling stations across the country, which were open from 8:00 to 20:00 on Sunday (except in Paris and Lyon where voting finished at 22:00, and French oversea possessions and other polling centers in the Americas, which voted on Saturday in order not to have them vote when the results are already known). A 70% turnout is very large compared to Spain 42%.\n\nThe result comes as no surprise to European political commentators as opinion polls had consistently suggested that the \"No\" camp was on course for a strong victory. Indeed, the last opinion poll before the actual referendum suggested a 56% win for the \"No\" camp.\n\nThe treaty was supported by all 3 major political parties (center-left PS, center-right UMP, center-right UDF), though a significant minority of the PS, and some in the UMP, chose to oppose it.\n\nIt was opposed by the French Communist Party, as well as Trotskyite movements such as the Revolutionary Communist League, other far-left movements such as the Party of the Workers, parts of the Socialist party, parts of The Greens some members of UMP, and the nationalist National Front.\n\nAccording to polls, the vast majority of blue collar workers, farmers and other categories threatened by globalization and international concurrence voted against the treaty. The urban, better educated or richer population voted in favor.\n\nSome supporters of the \"No\" camp have argued that the mainstream media was biased in favor of the \"yes\" cause, and this was supported by some analyses of times awarded by television to both camps. However, the \"no\" camp also waged an aggressive campaign, with the walls of major cities being plastered with posters linking the EU Constitution and the European Union to all kind of social ills, such as high unemployment.\n\nYou can read the entire proposed European Constitution at Wikisource\n\nAccording to polls collected by TNS-Sofres, the largest polling company in France, voters gave the following reasons for voting no:\n* 46% -- feared that unemployment would worsen under the constitution\n* 40% -- were discontent with the current situation in France\n* 35% -- believed a no would permit the constitution to be renegotiated\n* 34% -- found the constitution too economically liberal and difficult to understand\n* 19% -- thought the constitution threatened the identity of France\n* 18% -- wanted to prevent the entry of Turkey to the EU\n* 12% -- followed certain political leaders who asked them to vote no.\n\nNote, however, that such polls offer only a limited number of answers and may thus misrepresent the actual motives of the people.\n\nProponents of the \"No\" vote, both on the left and right, argued that the proposed constitution enshrined what they claim is an undemocratic Europe, with much of the responsibilities granted to a body of unelected political appointees, the European Commission and not enough checks and balances. They also point out that it vests much legislative power in the European Council, representing the executives of the various countries; this is seen as a bad arrangement with respect to Separation of powers. While the treaty adds supplemental powers for the directly elected European Parliament, many opponents, particularly on the left, consider that they are still insufficient in order to provide checks and balances.\n\nMuch criticism was directed at the length of the proposed Constitution. The real treaty submitted to French voters is about 80 pages long, which many argue is too long and complex for a constitution. It is followed by 100 pages of appendices, declarations and protocols, some of them dealing with matters such as oil refining in the Dutch West Indies or specific nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe.\n\nOpponents of the treaty argue that the proposed constitution will largely hamstring the French government and prevent it from leading its own policies in matters as diverse as social services or foreign policy.\n\nMuch of the opposition was targeted at Part&amp;nbsp;III of the proposed constitution, which sets the policies of the European Union. Opponents point out that the constitutions of most countries, including France, do not specify policies explicitly, except for a limited number of fundamental rights, but rather are limited to specifying the core principles and procedures of how governmental institutions work. Part&amp;nbsp;III, they argued, sets in stone a number of economic and social choices, while these should be a matter of political choice depending on democratic votes.\n\nBoth left-wing and right-wing opponents consider that some of these policies, already applied and enforced by the European Union, are disastrous for France's economy and society as well as European's economy and society. One primary target is the free trade policies with countries having less expensive workforce and social protection, which, they argue, drive French workers out of work (2.7 million French people are out of work).\n\nThis was recently exemplified by the so-called \"Bolkestein directive\", which would have enabled service providers in the European Union to work anywhere in the union according to the legislation and social practices of their own country, not of the country where they'd work: this was caricatured as the example of the \"Polish plumber\" coming to work for a meager fraction of what French plumbers demand.\n\nMuch is made of délocalisations &amp;mdash; that is, the transferring of industries and, now, services to countries with lower production costs, depriving French workers of jobs at a time when unemployment is high.\n\nAs a consequence, both left-wing and right-wing opponents of the treaty and of current and proposed European Union policies argue in favor of some sort of protectionism.\n\nIn the field of international relations, many opponents contend that the proposed constitution would make the European Union largely subservient to NATO, an institution dominated by the United States of America.\n\nA factor in the opposition to the constitution is the recent enlargement of the European Union, a major move which was not approved by a referendum. Opponents consider that open border concurrence with much poorer economies is bad for French economy; many express uneasiness at subsidizing and collaborating with governments that they consider subservient to the interests of the United States, such as Poland's (Poland chose to buy warplanes from the United States after receiving some European Union subsidies, a movement which resulted in many questioning the financial and diplomatic priorities of their government).\n\nFinally, many seized the occasion to express their discontent at France's political elite and to president Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin's government. While unemployment had receded under the rule of center-left former prime minister Lionel Jospin, it has climbed against under Raffarin's administration despite his and Chirac's promises.\n\nMuch opposition was directed towards what many on the Left consider the \"ultra-liberal\" character of the Constitution: that is, they argue, the proposed constitution makes permanent economic policies which they consider disastrous for French society:\n* the destruction of public services, with forced scaling-down and privatization (some groups tied the closure of post offices to the European Union);\n* the vesting of much power in the European Central Bank, governed by political appointees, with the sole goal of ensuring the stability of the markets whereas, opponents argue, a major objective should be the reduction of unemployment\n* the encouragement of fiscal and \"social dumping\", whereby companies relocate themselves to the countries with the lowest standards of social services.\n\nLeft wing opponents, they say, want Europe, but another Europe, which, in their view, would put the concerns of common people before those of financial markets and the wealthy. They contend that free market capitalism, which they consider enforced by the constitution, destroys lives and benefits the financial establishment, but not the average worker. They argue that open trade and concurrence encourages unemployment in France.\n\nThey argue, bluntly, that the constitution is the constitution of right-winger Chirac and MEDEF, the union of larger French private employers. MEDEF, due to its current leader Ernest-Antoine Seillière, is very unpopular among the left.\n\nLeft-wing opponents argued that the Charter of rights included in the constitution was largely indicative, not prescriptive. They questioned the say that other members of the union may have in matters such as the right to abortion and the separation of Church and State, which they consider threatened by certain governments from Catholic countries, which, during the negotiation of the treaties, had insisted on adding references to the Christian heritage of Europe.\n\nAnother argument from the left was that the Constitution called for member states to strengthen their military forces. Opponents argue that this would be wasteful spending, would result in an arm race with the United States, China and others, and would result in wars and more instability.\n\nMany leaders of the opposition to the \"No\" also simply called for a blow to Chirac.\n\nMany right-wing opponents argue that Turkey, which has applied for European Union membership, should not become a member, and that acceptance of the Constitution would pave the way for this. They point out that the new Eastern European members, whose joining many of them opposed, were accepted without a referendum; they also point out that Turkey is for the most part not located in Europe, but in the Middle-East, and that it borders countries such as Iran and Iraq.\n\nIn addition, many supporters of the right-wing are opposed to a union with countries whose culture they consider too far from France, and are concerned about unchecked immigration from these. They also consider that the direction the European Union is heading will only reinforce unchecked immigration from poor Muslim countries, which they think is bad socially and economically for Europe. This point of view is disputed by many economists, who point out that due to aging of France and other European countries increasing immigration is the only viable option for boosting the existing economies.\n\nSuch arguments are likely not to have much impact on many French voters. The results of this referendum, as well as those of the 2002 presidential election, show some deep distrust of the population for the political class as well as for \"experts\". There is high skepticism against economists and politicians who promote what they consider to be necessary reforms, whereas despite those reforms unemployment has remained high and standards of living have lessened for many.\n\nSupporters of the proposed European Constitution contend that it is a marked improvement over preceding treaties governing the European Union. They point out that it gives increased powers to the directly elected European Parliament compared to the politically appointed European Commission and European Council. They also point out that it gives a right of petition to European citizens, which they contend is a marked democratic advance. Opponents point out that this right may be exercised only with strict conditions (1,000,000 signatures from a \"significant\" number of countries) and with uncertain consequences. Furthermore, they point out that the basic undemocratic handling and procedures followed for the legislative enactment of laws are kept in place, and that neither the EC or the counsel of ministers have been internally made more democratic.\n\nProponents of the constitution consider that these improvements make the European Union markedly more democratic than it was before, while opponents may be of the opinion that something which is better then extremely bad, is still no good, and consider a no-vote a chance to come up with something better. Some supporters of the constitution contend that certain European measures that many consider ill-advised (such as the Bolkestein directive or the directive on software patents) would not have been adopted if the stronger checks and balances provided for by the constitution had been implemented, but there is little actual basis to support such a claim.\n\nPart&amp;nbsp;II of the proposed European Constitution is a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This charter lists a number of human rights, such as the prohibition of torture, the prohibition of the death penalty, etc., and reinstates that the Union follows the Council of Europe's (COE) European Convention on Human Rights and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). All members of the European Union must belong to the COE and accept ECHR jurisdiction. Proponents of the constitution consider that this reinstatement of human rights is of great import, especially with respect to recent new members, which may not have much of a tradition of democracy, rule of law and human rights.\n\nProponents of the constitution dispel the accusation that the constitution is ultra-libéral (i.e. supports unfettered free market and prohibits social policies in member countries). They contend that these dispositions are not new, and were already to be found in the 1957 Treaty of Rome. They point out that unbiased concurrence is a the heart of European policies since the beginnings of the European Economic Community.\n\nThey contend that, for a large part, the proposed constitution is just the consolidation of the preceding treaties governing the European Union into a single document.\n\nThey admit out that the Constitution, like all works designed by a committee out of compromise, may be bulky. However, they point out, France cannot expect to force its choices on other countries. While some French parties may have preferred that the constitution contains more \"social\" dispositions, such social dispositions would be opposed by countries such as the United Kingdom, and there is little hope that any renegotiation would get them accepted. French Citizens, they claim, should be ready to accept an imperfect text.\n\nSome supporters say that refusing the constitution will diminish the clout of France in European institutions and may make it more difficult in the future to have its interests be taken into account at that level.\n\nSome right-wing supporters of the treaty contend that the European Union is a necessary force in order to push what they consider to be necessary reforms upon France.\n\nSupporters of the treaty point out that the question of the constitution is disconnected from that of the accession of Turkey. President Chirac has pledged that the accession of Turkey would be put to a referendum before French voters (the accession treaty of former Eastern Bloc countries was ratified by the French Parliament without a referendum).\n\nFinally, supporters of the proposed Constitution point out that this referendum is about the ratification of a treaty, and is not a plebiscite on the actions of president Jacques Chirac and prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, both of which are deeply unpopular.",

    "original_text": "Myanmar\nitsdeadjim=1Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained leader of the National League for Democracy in Myanmar marked her 62nd birthday today, still under house arrest, where she has spent most of the past 17 years.\n\nAbout 250 supporters met at the National League for Democracy (NLD) headquarters in Yangon, not far from Suu Kyi's home, and held a rally calling for her release. Doves and balloons were released into the air, under the watchful eyes and video cameras of around 50 plainclothes police officers, who were stationed across the street.\n\nThe police force was augmented by a dozen truckloads of members of the Union Solidarity and Development Association, the political arm of the State Peace and Development, the junta that rules Myanmar.\n\n\"The doves symbolise peace. We also released colourful balloons, which rise like her prestige when they fill the sky,\" NLD women's wing leader Lai Lai was quoted as saying by Agence France Presse.\n\nWith the party marking marking Suu Kyi's birthday as \"Myanmar Women's Day,\" Lei Lei read out a statement at the ceremony, calling Suu Kyi \"irreplaceable\" and praising her \"honesty, bravery and perseverance.\"\n\nSecurity was beefed up around Suu Kyi's lakeside home on University Avenue, which is usually open to traffic during daytime, but is closed on significant anniversaries such as Suu Kyi's birthday or the May 30 anniversary of her detention.\n\nNLD supporters said police were also watching their homes.\n\n\"Plainclothes police circled around my house on their motorcycles last night until dawn,\" Su Su Nway, 34, was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse. She was arrested on May 15 with 60 others during a prayer rally for Suu Kyi in Yangon, and was released for health reasons on June 7. She said around 52 NLD supporters were still in custody.\n\nSuu Kyi is generally barred from receiving visitors, so she spent the day alone. Except for her maid, a personal physician, a dentist and an eye specialist, the only other person to visit with Suu Kyi in the past year was United Nations Undersecretary-General for Political Affairs Ibrahim Gambari, whom she met for one hour last November at a government guest house.\n\nWinner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for 11 of the past 17 years, continuously since 2003. Her National League for Democracy won a landslide election in 1990, but the military, which has ruled Myanmar since 1962, refused to honor the results. The country is also known as Burma, but the military government renamed it Myanmar in 1989.\n\nCalls for Suu Kyi's release have been issued by the NLD, various world bodies and other countries, but the pleadings have been met by no response from the generals.\n\n\"In our view, until their constitution is ratified, she will not be released,\" Sann Aung, a Bangkok-based leader of the Burmese government-in-exile was quoted as saying by Reuters.\n\n\"They are worried that she will be a threat to the National Convention and the referendum,\" he told Reuters, referring to the planned national referendum on a new constitution that is being written by the generals.\n\nThe Nation newspaper in Bangkok marked Suu Kyi's birthday with an editorial, saying that sanctions against the Myanmar regime have been ineffective.\n\n\"The junta has earned huge amounts of foreign revenue from oil and gas exports, with prices jacked up many times over. With rich mineral resources, energy hungry countries have been attracted to Burma despite the repressive nature of the junta,\" the editorial said, also making note of a recent deal that Russia has made to build nuclear reactor in Myanmar.\n\nThe paper also said Myanmar bodes ill for the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional grouping.\n\n\"As long as Aung San Suu Kyi remains incarcerated, ASEAN's reputation and the group's international standing will be tarnished. Asean leaders have repeatedly appealed to the Burmese junta to free her, but to no avail ... today, Burma is the black sheep of ASEAN. Without any current provisions for sanctions, Burma will remain as intransigent in the future as it is today.\"",

    "original_text": "In a 40-page report released today, the United Nations special envoys on torture reported their findings regarding the United States detention facility at Guantanamo Bay on the island of Cuba. The report concludes that certain procedures practised at the facility, and during transport to it, constitute torture. Moreover the report states that \"attempts by the United States Administration to redefine 'torture' in the framework of the struggle against terrorism, in order to allow certain interrogation techniques that would not be permitted under the internationally accepted definition of torture, are of utmost concern.\" The report goes on to state that \"the interrogation techniques authorized by the Department of Defense, particularly if used simultaneously, amount to degrading treatment in violation of article 7 of ICCPR and article 16 of the Convention against Torture.\"\n\nThe report recommends that the United States bring the detainees to trial \"in accordance with criminal procedure\" or \"release them without further delay\", and that \"The United States Government should close the Guantánamo Bay detention facilities without further delay.\" To avoid further practices amounting to \"torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, discrimination on the basis of religion, and violations of the rights to health and freedom of religion\" the report recommends that \"In particular, all special interrogation techniques authorized by the Department of Defense should immediately be revoked.\"\n\nIn response to the report, White House spokesperson Scott McClellan said that the facility housed \"dangerous terrorists\". US officials have dismissed most of the claims as \"largely without merit\" and pointed out that the authors of the report never visited Guantanamo Bay, despite an invitation issued to three of the five investigators in November.\n\nIn an interview with the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit the United Nation's Special Rapporteur on torture and coauthor of the report Manfred Nowak said that it was the \"sole responsibility of the United States that we could not visit Guantanamo\". He adds that the United States explicitly barred the UN inspectors from talking to detainees, without which proper investigations are impossible. He pointed out that the need for interviews with prisoners, in order for considering investigations to be comprehensive, \"is also the position of the United States when it concerns other countries, like China\".",

Charlie Hebdo is known for its ferocious critical tone and general hostility towards organized religion.\n\nCharlie Hebdo normally prints 140,000 copies; 160,000 were printed of these issues, but were sold out before midday. The paper announced an exceptional re-issue of 160,000 the next day. According to Le Figaro, the final printout could exceed 400,000.\n\nSome French Muslim associations had tried to obtain an injunction against the publishing of the paper, claiming that the cartoons incited to racial and religious hatred, but the court rejected their request on procedural grounds, as recommended by the public prosecutor. The judge, Jean-Claude Magendie, remarked that the 1881 law on the Press is very formal in order to protect the rights of defense with respect to freedom of speech.\n\nThe French government had law enforcement officers, many equipped for riot control, guard the outside of the parisian offices of the paper, should some protesters try to disrupt public order. However, at mid-day, no protesters could be seen. Charlie Hebdo is normally highly critical of police action and extraordinary security measures.\n\nAnother French satirical weekly, Le Canard enchaîné did not publish the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons because they were, according to it, \"not very fun and not very original\", but published series of cartoons mocking Islamists (those exploiting the Muslim faith for political purposes). The Canard called them \"Satanic drawings\", in a probable allusion to The Satanic Verses, a novel whose author was sentenced to death by Islamists.\nCharlie Hebdo\nJyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy",

Cable providers will take the signals to 40 million subscriber. This, claims Al Jazeera, is a unique event in terms of the scale of audience already available at the time of launch. Sky, a leading satellite broadcaster will distribute Al Jazeera English.\n\nAt the same time, Al Jazeera's English website, aljazeera.net/English, will have a new look and will provide live streams of the TV channel, RSS feeds, e-mail, newsletters and interactive discussion boards and will allow everyone to \"express their opinion freely, encouraging debates, viewpoints and counter viewpoints\". Notably, aljazeera.com is an unrelated website publishing inflammatory opinion articles about Middle East issues.\n\nAl Jazeera claims to be impartial and says that its team of journalists \"share a common set of attributes: objectivity, accuracy, and a passion for truth\". It is supported by the Emir of Qatar, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who enabled it to start up with a grant of $150M and it is said to receive $30m annually from him.\n\nNigel Parson, al-Jazeera International's British managing director, said he intended to bring home to British viewers what was being done in their name. He would not hesitate to show dead soldiers in \"long shots\" and with \"pixilated faces\", even before their next of kin had been told. The Telegraph reports reactions of two opposition defence spokesmen: \"a promotion of brutality\" and \"grotesque\" said a Tory and \"banning such material could result in the public getting a sanitised, cleaned-up version of those realities\" voiced by a Liberal Democrat. The Ministry of Defence is reported as saying that the public had a right to know what goes on in operational theatres, but expected media to report with \"consideration of the welfare of service families\".\n\nThe London office has contributors from the BBC including Sir David Frost, Rageh Omaar and Darren Jordon, and from ITN, Shiulie Ghosh.\n\nAl Jazeera is often criticised in the West. On one occasion its offices were bombed by the U.S., when on 13 November 2001, a U.S. missile hit Al Jazeera's office in Kabul, Afghanistan. On 8 April 2003 a U.S. missile hit a generator near the Baghdad office and the subsequent fire killed a reporter. In Spain, Al Jazeera reporter Taysir Allouni was sentenced to seven years for being a financial courier for al-Qaeda. He claims that his only association with that group was an interview with bin Laden after 9/11.",

Foreign ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said that any plan has to acknowledge Iran's legal rights under international law, including Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n\nIt is believed that Britain, France, and Germany, all member states of the EU, are developing incentives for Iran to give up its enrichment programming in an attempt to defuse mutual fears and perceptions of threats by US, Israeli, and Iranian governments. The incentives are believed to include a raft of security, trade and technology benefits.\n\nThe proposal by the three EU members encourages other nations to support the construction of light water power generation reactors, to set up a nuclear fuel bank and the relaxation of United States trade restrictions to allow Iran to purchase commercial planes built in the US. These incentives are conditional upon Iran renouncing its rights under Article IV of the NPT, i.e. stopping its Uranium enrichment program, and cooperating with the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in ways additional to its present cooperation, which at present includes continuous monitoring of many key Iranian nuclear facilities by the IAEA.\n\nIf Iran doesn't comply, Britain, France and Germany will support economic sanctions against Iran, the refusal to issue visas to Iranian officials and a freeze on the assets belonging to individuals and corporations with ties to the Iranian regime.\n\nMr Asefi said he would not comment on the proposal at this stage. He said it would be \"hasty to comment on a raw proposal that has been brought up in the media, and still neither officially nor unofficially given to us.\"\n\nMr Asefi said that any plan would have to recognise Iran's rights to be considered. \"The basis of our work is that the Islamic Republic of Iran's rights must be recognised in any plan,\" he said.\n\n\"We cannot retreat. The proposal should provide ways to secure our rights,\" he said. \"We will not stop enrichment.\"\n\nMr. Asefi warned Europe against economic sanctions saying that they would harm Europe. \"We have broad trade and economic ties with European and non-European countries. These ties can be damaged and this damage will harm European countries even more.\" he said.",

The proposal to list polar bears has resulted from a lawsuit settlement the Bush administration reached in February with Greenpeace and the Natural Resources Defense Council, and a decsion was to be made 12 months after that settlement, based on the Endangered Species Act petition process.\n\n\"Today the Interior Department's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to list polar bears as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. We are making this proposal because a scientific review of the species by the Fish and Wildlife service found that populations may be threatened by receding sea ice, which polar bears use as a platform for many activities essential to their life cycle, including hunting for their main prey, Arctic seals,\" said Dirk Kempthorne, the Secretary of the Interior in the U.S.\n\n\"Polar bears are one of nature's ultimate survivors, but we are concerned the polar bears' habitat may literally be melting,\" added Kempthorne.\n\n\"We have never had a species listed with such a close correlation to climate change as this one,\" said an attorney with Natural Resources Defense Council, Andrew Wetzler.\n\n\"Global warming is the single biggest threat to polar bears' survival, and this will require the government to address the impacts on the polar bear,\" added Wetzler.\n\nThe \"threatened\" category encompasses \"vulnerable,\" \"endangered,\" and \"critically endangered.\" Currently, polar bears are listed as \"vulnerable\" under the World Conservation Union.\n\nAlthough the United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service makes no formal mention of increasing or decreasing polar bear population within US borders or worldwide, it is estimated that there are between 22,000 and 25,000 polar bears living, some 4,700 are living in the state of Alaska, and about 15,000 live in Canada.",

    "original_text": "Pope Benedict XVI began his visit to the United States on Tuesday. In an unprecedented gesture, he was greeted by President George W. Bush, Laura Bush and their daughter Jenna, upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.\n\nToday, which is also the Pope's 81st birthday, Benedict XVI visited the White House and more than 9,000 people with tickets were there to see him speak. This makes it \"one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House,\" according to White House Press Secretary Dana Perino. An estimated additional 4,000 people without tickets lined the streets.\n\nThe Pope was given a 21-gun salute and greeted by President Bush on the South Lawn of the White House. Benedict XVI addressed the crowd in a short speech. He appealed for support \"for the patient efforts of international diplomacy to resolve conflicts and promote progress.\"\n\nHe further said, \"As the nation faces the increasingly complex political and ethical issues of our time, I am confident that the American people will find in their religious beliefs a precious source of insight and an inspiration to pursue reasoned, responsible and respectful dialogue in the effort to build a more humane and free society.\" Benedict said he has \"great respect for this vast pluralistic society\" and ended his speech with \"God bless America.\"\n\nKevin Waymel, 26, travelled from San Francisco with 80 others to see the Pope. He told The Guardian that he had \"come to show support for the Holy Father,\" and credited his faith for getting him off drugs.\n\nAfterwards, inside the White House, the first couple presented the Pope with a birthday cake. In a private meeting with Bush, Benedict XVI brought up his concerns about the Iraq war and the treatment of illegal immigrants in the United States, who may number as many as 20 million. Most of these are from Latin America and therefore overwhelmingly Catholic.\n\nAfter the meeting, Benedict XVI rode along Pennsylvania Avenue in the popemobile with throngs of people lining the street.\n\nWednesday evening, the Pope met with US bishops at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He addressed the bishops about sexual abuse by the clergy, which the Pope has said made him \"deeply ashamed.\" The US Catholic Church has paid out an estimated US$2 billion to settle abuse cases in recent years.\n\nBendict XVI told the gathered bishops that the sex abuse scandal had at times been mishandled and urged them to reach out to the victims.\n\n\"It is your God-given responsibility as pastors to bind up the wounds caused by every breach of trust to foster healing, to promote reconciliation and to reach out with loving concern to those so seriously wronged,\" the Pope said.\n\nSome victims had hoped the Pope would have critcised bishops for transferring pedophile priests from parish to parish. He did not go that far and instead praised training programs for priests and lay people who deal with children. \"In this regard your efforts to heal and protect are bearing great fruit not only for those directly under your pastoral care, but for all of society,\" said Benedict XVI.\n\n\"It's the closest the Pope has come to saying that the bishops didn't do their job right. I think that's quite significant,\" said the Reverend Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit priest and author.\n\nPrior to his arrival, hundreds of people were already gathered outside the Basilica as Benedict XVI arrived. \"I'm really excited,\" said an unnamed onlooker to NY1. \"It's like a dream, almost. There are, like, other foreign dignitaries, and then there's the pope. It's a unique experience and I can't wait to see him.\"\n\nDuring his flight to the United States, Benedict XVI told reporters that he intended to discuss poverty and development aid to poor countries with President Bush. \"The United States has to help these countries develop. It is in the interest of everyone, not only these countries but of the world and particularly of the United States,\" he said.\n\nThis is the first Papal visit to the United States by Benedict XVI, and the first visit of a Pope to the U.S. since John Paul II's visit in 1999. The pope scheduled to stay in Washington through Thursday. After that, he will travel to New York City where he plans to address the United Nations, visit the World Trade Center site, and celebrate Mass at Yankee Stadium.",

    "original_text": "From October 22 to 25, Taipei Computer Association (TCA) promoted three organized or sponsored expositions including \"2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase &amp; Conference\", \"Exhibition of the First 5-year Period of the National Science &amp; Technology Program of e-Learning\", and \"2007 IP Comm Asia\" showing great determination on improving the IT industry in Taiwan. With Computex Taipei 2008 will add Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall (TWTC Nangang) area, how TCA transform their ways and goals with operating their IT shows? It will be affected on the notibility of domestic or trade shows. For the three expos status and TWTC Nangang topics, Wikinews Reporter Brock interviewed TCA Secretary General Enoch Du for some important questions that should be respected by organizers and governments.\n\nBrock: We saw three expos continuously appeared this week and witnessed the determination from TCA. But before the three expos, with the 2008 Computex Taipei Local Exhibitors' Coordination by TAITRA last month for the exhibition hall usage, what should TCA face on the twin halls (TWTC Hall 1 and TWTC Nangang) problem? How to solve the problem with TWTC Nangang? Because more than ten years before, when Computex Taipei exhibited at Sungshan and TWTC halls, the show didn't have a good work, and I've asked Commissioner of Department of Transportation in Taipei City Hsiao-hsien Lou for the traffic issue with TWTC Nangang, he looked it as a pessimistic way.\n\nEnoch: We still contact with TAITRA currently for the twin halls issue, The advantage for TWTC Nangang is exhibition spaces, but to the opposite way, traffic is surely a great headache for governments, organizers, and exhibitors. We still try to solve problems with this. Even though Computex Taipei will be located at TWTC Exhibition Hall and TWTC Nangang same time with the plan of TAITRA, but without solving problems, Computex Taipei will still be in a trouble even though we want to challenge the World's 1st scale against CeBIT.\n\nBrock: It's apparently that lots of organizations care about the traffic near TWTC Nangang. By the way, for the 1st time TCA holding 2007 IP Comm Asia, why should it be transformed from a long-historical trade show - Taipei Telecom by TAITRA, suspended from this year?\n\nEnoch: TCA explained some reasons for the transformation in the starting of 2007. In fact, lots of famous local participants (exhibitors) usually promoted their products with show-girls (models) so the quality of Taipei Telecom went from bad to worse in past 2 to 5 years. This is surely a damn bad demonstration in Taiwan's society. With suspending Taipei Telecom and promoting IP telecommunication industry in Taiwan, TCA finally decided to hold this professional trade show and named \"IP Comm Asia\" for the global market opportunity this year.\n\nBrock: Continued with \"IP Comm Asia\", how this show connect with \"2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase &amp; Conference\"?\n\nEnoch: Communication and networking (including WiMAX) industries should be complementaries. In Taiwan, IP telecommunication infrastructure shouldn't be looked down, with the trendy change of telecommunication industry, even though traditional telecommunication (fax and phone) industry is currently in a prior position, but IP telecommunication will be a new industry besides of communication and networking with computing technology. If consumers can communicate via Internet including Wi-Fi, its development will take advantage. Currently, some of telecommunication companies tried to change the quality of VoIP and experiment related applications for the market preparation, if the wireless network contained broadly and WiMAX infrastructure improved rapidly in Taiwan, I think that IP telecommunications will be the main stream in the future.\n\nBrock: Something interesting. Some of electronic trade shows held by TAITRA had a great transformation with combinations and changes such as a 3-in-1 show (TaiwanRFID, TAITRONICS, PV Taiwan) held past 2 weeks. Recently, TAITRA set \"Broadband Communications Pavilion\" at 2007 TAITRONICS Autumn to promote \"Broadband Taiwan 2008\" at TWTC Nangang and recruit companies with Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association. How the TCA think about this idea?\n\nEnoch: With trendy changes of electronic industry in Taiwan, several (electronic) trade shows suspended or transformed to other industry shows. As of TAITRA, they should fill up vacancies with some specified trade shows by some grown up industries. With their idea, they successfully transformed a simple electronic show to a grand combination with multiple industries' show. As you talked about the pavilion at TAITRONICS, this was a great chance for TAITRA to reposition and restart. Every show organizer always hopes their (international) show can keep good images for international buyers. Hope TWTC Nangang can bring a bright future and have a good start, and TAITRA can complete solutions for TWTC Nangang to keep TWTC Exhibition Hall in a steady position.\n\nBrock: Nice thanks. Hope I can visit some good shows by TCA.\n\nTCA surely worked hard with promoting IT industry by executing governmental plans and holding trade shows at TWTC or outside of Taiwan. That's why the IT industry in Taiwan can market to the world. TCA usually reposition some IT trade shows from quantity (factor) to quality with holding shows. Exhibition organizers in Taiwan should respect quality of exhibitions and conventions so that Taiwan can be visible world-wide in the future. With Du's words, if Computex Taipei should use twin halls, then TAITRA should solve the main issue of Nangang's traffic as Commissioner Luo said to keep them in a steady position, origins and quality.",

    "original_text": "War in South Ossetia (2008)The War in South Ossetia has escalated as Russian forces are being sent into the conflict on the Ossetian side.\n\nAt 10:00 a.m. local time, Georgian sources reported that three Russian Su-24 attack aircraft invaded Georgian air space and dropped bombs onto a target near the town of Kareli. A later flight dropped one bomb near Gori. While no one was harmed in the second attack, seven people were reportedly injured by the first bombing. According to the Agence France-Presse, a speaker of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called this information \"nonsense\" and \"rubbish\".\n\nAt 11:38 a.m. the President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili announced the mobilization of reserve troops to withstand what he called \"a large-scale military aggression\" by Russia, and called Russia to stop the \"bombardment of Georgian towns.\"\n\nPrime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin said that, \"it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the Olympic Games, the Georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in South Ossetia.\"\n\nThe crisis broke out after days of heavy fighting in the region. On August 7 Georgian troops launched an offensive against the Ossetian town of Tskhinvali, the separatist's capital.\n\nThe Georgian government claims that this is in reaction to attacks by \"separatist rebels\" on \"unarmed civilians and peacekeeping forces\" in villages near the town.\n\nAt the same time, the state news agency of South Ossetia reports that that Tskhinvali is under heavy artillery fire, with most or all of its population seeking shelter, and apparently a number of buildings already having been destroyed. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) urged the two sides to set up a \"humanitarian corridor\" to evacuate civilians and the wounded. The main city hospital is reported not to be functioning, and ambulances can not reach the wounded. Thousands of refugees are leaving South Ossetia, mostly for North Ossetia, says the United Nations refugee agency.\n\nGeorgian officials have claimed that up to four Russian jets have been shot down while attacking Georgia.\n\nRussia claimed ceasing all civilian aircraft flights to Georgia starting at midnight on August 9. In retaliatory response, Georgia is set to stop all Russian TV channels' broadcasts from August 9th onwards.\n\nAccording to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reporting at 9:21pm August 8th, a convoy of 20 vans carrying up to a total of 400 Russian volunteers has crossed from Russia's North Ossetia to South Ossetia.\n\nThe government of South Ossetia has announced that it will evacuate children in danger zones to Russia. This came after a speech made by Eduard Kokoity, President of South Ossetia, which accused the Georgian government of \"attempting to spark a full-scale war.\" Kokoity said that the conflict's victim count has reached 1400.\n\nAs of 10:51pm August 8th, 12 Russian peacemakers are reported dead and 150 wounded.\n\nA video tape showing Georgian Su-25 aircraft being downed was aired on Vesti Russian TV channel late night of August 8th. The pilot of the jet reportedly ejected, but was captured and killed on the ground by Ossetian military.",

Temporary warehouses are being set up around the city to deal with corpse storage.\n\nIn the last twenty-four to thirty-six hours, however, officials have revised downward, at least three times, the estimated death toll; 35,000, 10,000, and now less than 10,000. After the first sweep of the city devoted to recovery of bodies, officials retrieved approximately 800 bodies.\n\nFloodwaters are receding, but leaving a great deal of mud and contaminated water in their wake, filled with high levels of bacteria and viruses.\n\nAll survivors are urged to leave the city. Dr. Julie Gerberding, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said \"If you haven't left the city yet, you must do so,\" and stated that anyone who comes in contact with the toxic water must immediately wash themselves with clean water. If necessary, force will be used to remove all remaining citizens from New Orleans.\n\nWhile Dr. Gerberding's statement about mandatory evacuation seems clear, other officials have not been as emphatic. When asked about mandatory evacuations, New Orleans Police Superintendent Eddie Compass, while reaffirming the official word, qualified his statement stating that every reasonable means would be used to logically convince a person that it is in his best interest to evacuate. The superintendent would not comment on whether force would be used if reason failed. Furthermore, utility workers are in the process of re-establishing power to the Central Business District of the city prompting residents in those areas to reconsider the evacuation option.\n\nAnimal rights campaigners are protesting against evidence that law enforcement officers are killing animals as a form of control. According to HelpingAnimals.com, pets left behind by evacuees are being shot.\n\nResidents of Jefferson Parish, and the upper portions of Saint Bernard Parish will be allowed to return permanently to their homes starting on Monday. Conditions in those areas &amp;mdash; re-establishment of power, clearing of roads, and abatement of water &amp;mdash; have improved to the point of making permanent return possible. Parish President Arron Broussard and Councilor Jennifer Sneed stated that residents should be allowed to return as soon as possible so repairs and rebuilding may begin.\n\nCompanies are working with the US Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide money and support to the victims of Katrina, in order to ease them into a new life. In addition, a contract for approximately thirty-three million dollars to repair the I-10 span crossing the eastern portion of Lake Pontchartrain has been awarded. Many of the bridge sections, especially on the eastern-facing span, were knocked off their pilings as hurricane Katrina passed close to the city. The contractor expects one span to be repaired and opened for traffic within forty-five days.",

The white men also face five malicious harassment charges alleging the victims were targeted based on their race.\n\nPolice say Jake England, 19, and Alvin Watts, 33, confessed to the attacks. An affidavit says England shot three of the victims and Watts pulled the trigger on the other two. The apparently random attacks killed Dannaer Fields, 49, Bobby Clark, 54, and William Allen, 31. David Hall, 46, and Deon Tucker, 44, were hospitalised but survived and were discharged.\n\nAll were shot within three miles of each other on April 6 in a predominantly black area of the city; all but one were shot within a single mile of each other. The deceased were all hit in the chest. Hall was hit in the stomach and Tucker in the shoulder. Bond for each suspect has already been set at over $9 million, and no pleas have been entered. A witness to one shooting described a pickup pulling over so occupants could seek directions before someone inside fired a gun.\n\nA two-day manhunt concluded with the arrests last Sunday and police say the killing of England's father Carl by black man Pernell Demond Jefferson gave the younger suspect a possible \"axe to grind\". Jefferson was threatened by the elder England following an earlier incident and no charges were filed on the basis Jefferson acted in self defense.\n\nJake England recently wrote in Facebook \"it's hard not to go off,\" which was in reference to the second year since his father's death. Court documents say prior anonymous tips to police said England \"has mentioned he will die in a shootout with the police if he has to\" and harbors racist views. Friends and relatives say his father's death and girlfriend's suicide earlier this year have affected his mindset.\n\nTulsa County First Assistant District Attorney Doug Drummond called the events \"a tragic and senseless crime.\" Oklahoma law allows for life or death sentences for murder. The malicious harassment charges, which apply to some forms of discrimination, can fetch a year in prison each. Defense lawyer Clark Brewster yesterday called it \"a misplaced premise that England was motivated by any racial hate.\"\n\nThe accused, who are roommates and self-employed workmen, will be arraigned after the weekend.

Scaramucci had only held the position for ten days but had already received criticism after a profanity-laced phone call to a reporter from The New Yorker. President Trump forced Scaramucci's resignation after his new Chief of Staff, General John Kelly, made the decision, The New York Times reported. General Kelly replaced Reince Priebus who resigned on Friday.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, White House Press Secretary, released a statement after Scaramucci's dismissal. She said, \"Anthony Scaramucci will be leaving his role as White House Communications Director. Mr. Scaramucci felt it was best to give chief of staff John Kelly a clean slate and the ability to build his own team. We wish him all the best.\"\n\nScaramucci was criticised after an on-the-record phone call with New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza. Scaramucci contacted Lizza after it was reported he was at dinner with Fox News host Sean Hannity and Bill Shine, a former executive also for Fox News. In the phone call, he demanded Lizza reveal who leaked the details of the dinner and suspected Reince Priebus was responsible. He said, \"Reince is a fucking paranoid schizophrenic, a paranoiac\". He went on to mimic Priebus by saying, \"Let me leak the fucking thing and see if I can cock block these people the way I cock blocked Scaramucci for six months.\" In the same phone call he also criticised White House strategist Steve Bannon. He was quoted as saying, \"I'm not Steve Bannon, I'm not trying to suck my own cock\".\n\nHuckabee Sanders commented on the phone call in her statement saying, \"The President certainly felt that Anthony's comments were inappropriate for someone in that position and he didn't want to burden Gen. Kelly also with that line of succession\".\n\nIt has been confirmed Scaramucci was not reassigned within the administration. In his resignation Scaramucci reportedly requested to be redeployed to the US's Export-Import Bank as chief strategy officer. He was previously vice president and chief strategy officer at the Export-Import Bank.\n\nScaramucci was the third communications director of Trump's presidency. Michael Dubke resigned from the position in May while former Press Secretary Sean Spicer assumed some of the role.\n\nBefore joining the White House, Scaramucci was a Wall Street financier and founded SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm. Though not always a supporter of President Trump, he later advised him during last year's US presidential campaign. In 2012, he was the national finance co-chair for the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. Before aligning himself with Trump, he fundraised for the GOP primary campaigns of both Scott Walker and Jeb Bush.",

The biggest issue is the price of software: Microsoft will sell its low-end version of Windows 7 for 15 times as much as is charged for pirated copies.\n\nIn a bid to tackle the problem, Microsoft began an unconventional campaign in China last year that caused a black screen to be displayed every hour for users of pirated versions of Windows XP (Windows Genuine Advantage was distributed through automatic updates). However, that caused thousands of irate users to migrate to free software from domestic companies such as Kingsoft.\n\nSome people have said that free web-based software, supported by advertising, may ultimately help to reduce piracy in China by letting third parties pay for development costs.\n\nAnother likely competitor of Windows 7 is Mac OS: its sales figures have consistently grown every time a new Windows operating system has launched over the last 10 years.",

Smith will be the eleventh incarnation of the Doctor, taking over from actor David Tennant who will end his time with the series after filming four editions of the program through 2009. The Doctor comes from a race of Timelords, and has the ability to \"regenerate\" and change appearance when his health is failing. William Hartnell was the first actor to play the Doctor, from 1963–1966. Smith will become the new occupant of the Doctor's time machine and spacecraft the \"TARDIS\" in 2010.\n\n4=Robert Goodwill\nJohn Harper, founder of the Scarborough and Ryedale Astronomical Society and a fan of the series, called the decision to cast 26-year-old Smith in the role \"wonderful\". MP for Scarborough Robert Goodwill, also a fan of the program, told the Scarborough Evening News: \"David Tennant will be a very hard act to follow, but I’m optimistic that the new Doctor will be just as good.\"\n\n4=Andrew Buchan\nMatt Smith, 26, portrayed researcher Danny Foster on the political drama Party Animals, which aired on BBC Two in 2007. Fellow actor Andrew Buchan from Party Animals told The Guardian: \"It's a sublime bit of casting. He's got that huge hair, a twinkle in his eye — Matt's the king of geek chic. He is possibly going to be one of the best Doctors we've ever had.\"\n\nAfter a back injury got in the way of Smith's goal of becoming a footballer, his drama teacher Jerry Hardingham at Northampton School for Boys encouraged him to pursue acting. Though Smith did not audition, Hardingham cast him in a school production of the play Twelve Angry Men. Hardingham later convinced Smith to join the National Youth Theatre, and he landed the lead role in the play Murder in the Cathedral, performing before members of the British Royal Family and other VIPs at the Westminster Cathedral.\n\nDavid Tennant, 37, has portrayed the Doctor on Doctor Who since taking over for Christopher Eccleston in 2005. A major feature of his character's stories involved a romantic interest in his companion in the TARDIS, Rose, played by actress Billie Piper.\n\nTennant announced his exit from the program on October 29, 2008, at the National Television Awards in the United Kingdom, during his speech accepting the outstanding drama performance award at the program. Doctor Who was recognized with the award for most popular drama program.\n\nWhat do you think of the casting choice for the 11th incarnation of Doctor Who?\n\"I love this part, and I love this show so much that if I don't take a deep breath and move on now I never will, and you'll be wheeling me out of the Tardis in my bath chair,\" said Tennant in his address to the audience in attendance at the Royal Albert Hall. He was previously recognized at the National Television Awards for his role in Doctor Who with the award for most popular actor, in 2006 and 2007.\n\nTennant is currently performing the lead role in Hamlet with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and his engagement at the Novello Theatre in Westminster, London is set to end on January 10. He portrayed Hamlet 60 times with the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon prior to the production's move to London.",

The CPI also expressed concern at the fact that a foreign country was being allowed to interfere in India's internal affairs. \n\nThe U.S embassy in India had earlier offered to help train local law-enforcement authorities in Chattisgarh and to remove thousands of land mines planted by Naxals in the area. Reports stated that America's offer had been \"welcomed\" by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state. This is the first time another nation has offered to help India tackle Naxalism in the latter country.\n\nThe Communist Party of India's Politburo reacted sharply to the offer, and condemned the Chattisgrah government for allowing foreign interference in India's affairs without the prior consent of the Centre. The CPI also asked the Central Government to clarify to the U.S Embassy that Washington's involvement in India's internal affairs was not welcome. CPI leaders A. B Bardhan and Shamim Faizi said such meddling was not new for the US, and recalled US Ambassador David Mulford's letter to West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee criticising the latter's remarks against the American interference in India's internal matters. The CPI had recently criticised the Centre for voting against Iran at the IAEA.\n\nChattisgarh is one of at least 13 Indian states combating Naxals and Maoists who claim they are fighting for the rights of the impoverished peasants in the region. Thousands have died over three decades of violence, and the last 17 months have seen a rise in the number of attacks. The Indian Army released a report earlier this year that showed that by 2010, 30% of India's land area could become part of the \"Red-Corridor\", which currently stretches from the Indo-Nepal border all the way down to the Southern State of Andhra Pradesh. Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh stated last month that Naxals were a big threat to India's internal security.",

No one was injured or killed in the strikes.\n\n\"In response to rocket and mortar fire today, the air force has attacked a number of targets in the (Gaza) Strip, including six tunnels and a Hamas position,\" said the Israeli military in a statement to the press.\n\nAt least 13 mortar shells and three Qassam rockets were fired into Southern Israel Sunday night, four landing in Sha'ar HaNegev where two IDF soldiers and one civilian were injured. Ehud Olmert, the Israeli prime minister, stated just before the airstrikes that the attacks would cause a military response.\n\n\"The cabinet's position from the first moment was that if the south's residents are fired on, our response will naturally be disproportionate,\" said Olmert to reporters.\n\nHamas had earlier called the threats by Israel a way to \"find false pretexts to increase its aggression against the people\" of the Strip. Hamas had said they were not responsible for the rocket fire. Smaller previously unknown groups are saying to be taking responsibility, but Israel says that they hold Hamas responsible for any rocket attacks into Israel from the Strip.\n\nEarlier the IDF reportedly made phone calls, using a recorded message, to warn residents in Gaza of the airstrikes and told them to evacuate immediately. \"All those residing near a terror hub, a tunnel or a weapons cache must leave the area immediately,\" said the message.",

Vista claims to have improved graphics, more effective tools for finding documents, pictures and other items on PCs, and a new Internet browser.\n\nVista's release has been victim to a series of delays, the most recent delay was blamed in part on efforts to improve security of the OS.\n\nIn its quest to get Vista up and running, Microsoft also has had to scrap some of its original goals, including getting rid of a more sophisticated method for sorting and organizing information. Analysts have said that scaling back the system could hurt the company if people don't see enough of a reason to upgrade.\n\nThe most recent delays also forced Microsoft to miss the holiday season, possibly dealing a blow to computer makers and retailers who would have been hoping for the new OS to boost holiday gift sales.\n\nMicrosoft and other computer manufacturers are offering holiday shoppers coupons good for a free or discounted Vista upgrade.\n\nIt's not clear how quickly big businesses will start using Vista. It can often take months if not years for companies to test a new operating system and make sure it will work well with the other programs they rely on.\n\nAllchin said Microsoft is providing tools that allow companies to test for compatibility problems more quickly than with past Windows releases. He also said he hopes the security improvements would drive companies to upgrade faster.\n\nMicrosoft estimates that the new OS could set off a hike of 10% or more in Windows software sales in the financial year to June 30, with most of the increase coming in the second half of the year.\n\nMicrosoft shares rose 3 cents (from US$ 28.95) to close at US$28.98 Wednesday on the NASDAQ.",

The nearly US$300 million contract stated that bullets were coming from Hungary, but were actually decades-old, damaged and corroded bullets from China.\n\nOfficials from the Army Legal Services Agency notified Diveroli, via a letter, that his company is suspended from future contracting with any U.S. government agency. The letter came as part of an Army investigation since November regarding violation of the contract.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Diveroli signed papers back on November 25, 2007 certifying that 28 pallets of ammunition for Afghanistan had been manufactured by MFS 2000, a Hungarian company, according to a memo written by investigators.\n\nAEY violated the contract by breaking two clauses, one stating that the ammunition could not be acquired directly or indirectly from the People’s Republic of China, which is a violation of American law. The other clause specified that it must be packaged to comply with best commercial practices for international shipment.\n\nAccording to the Times, says the ammunition arrived in decomposing cardboard boxes which contained ammunition dating as far back as 1966. However, Army officials believe some ammunition even dates back further to 1962.\n\nThe Army had contracted with AEY in January 2007 to supply various types of nonstandard ammunition for use by the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, an Army official said on background. The company was required to purchase the ammunition and deliver it to Kabul International Airport in Afghanistan. AEY was recently awarded a delivery order amount of $48,717,553 on March 17, 2007 as part of the $298,004,398 contract.\n\nAlso according to the Times, when purchasing the ammunition, AEY worked with middlemen and a shell company which has been placed on federal list of entities suspected of illegal arms trafficking. Also, the Times reported that, Diveroli was secretly recorded in conversation that suggested corruption on his company's purchase of 100 million aging rounds from Albania.\n\nBryan Whitman, The Pentagon's spokesperson told reporters that suspension of the contract was due to the violation of the origin of the ammunition and the packaging of the ammunition, not the safety and performance.\n\n“Safety and performance has not apparently been a factor, according to our folks in Afghanistan. They have had no safety incidents reported and no reports of any ammunition that has malfunctioned associated with this particular contract,” Whitman told the press.\n\nHe also denied that the issue happened because the Army awarded the contract to the lowest bidder and that he was not aware of AEY's qualifications to fulfill the contract.\n\n“As the United States government does business, they are obviously always trying to ensure they get the best value,” he said. “But that does not mean that, in achieving the best value for the taxpayer, that we will accept something that is below standard for what it is we are purchasing, either.”\n\n4=Michael Diveroli, Efrain's father\nAccording to an Army official, the suspension of the contract will not have an impact on Afghanistan operations and other contractors are expressing interest into entering into a contract. “Besides, there’s no shortage of ammunition already in Afghanistan. This will have no impact,\" he said.\n\nMichael Diveroli, Efrain's father, who originally founded AEY as a small printing business, said of his son's career choice to CBS' Miami affiliate, WFOR, \"I would prefer he became a nice Jewish doctor or lawyer rather than an arms dealer. He's never asked for my approval on the company. He doesn't always take my advice, I don't influence him. As a father of a boy genius he's hard to control.\"\n\nAngelo Diveroli, Efrain's grandfather said the young man frequently accompanied him to gun shows when he was younger and became an expert at weapons.\n\nA friend of Diveroli said to WFOR, \"The government came here and checked him out and gave him the contract. How do you give someone, a 21 year old kid a contract like that?\"\n\nThe United States Army Criminal Investigation Command is continuing their investigation, according to officials.",

The 48-year-old driver, who alerted emergency services to the incident, was uninjured but apparently shaken.\n\nSergeant Jo McPherson of Police Scotland said of the area in which the accident occurred: \"Despite it being in the early hours of the morning this route can often be busy with taxis and cars as people make their way out of the city centre.\" Appealing to potential witnesses for information, Sergeant McPherson said: \"The area is also overlooked by residential flats and it's possible someone may have witnessed the crash from their flat.\"",

Many of those killed appeared to be children. Some of the pictures and video coming out of the country don't show blood and dismembered bodies, but instead show, according to witnesses, those who died from apparent suffocation; some were foaming at the mouth and others were having convulsions. One video posted to YouTube purportedly shows a young girl who survived the alleged attack, yelling \"I’m alive, I’m alive.\" At one point, according to The Washington Post, the girl even tries to convince the hospital official she is still alive.\n\nThe bombings come as United Nations observers began to arrive to investigate claims of chemical weapons use elsewhere in the nation. According to Russian officials, the Syrian government is ready to give UN observers \"maximum cooperation\" while they perform their investigation.\n\n\"We hope that the results will clarify the issue and will help to dispel numerous speculations around the alleged use of the Syrian chemical weapons while simultaneously creating a positive background for the moves towards the start of the political process of settlement of the Syrian crisis,\" Aleksandr Lukashevich, Russia's foreign minister, said yesterday. Syrian officials say the alleged chemical attack was staged and carried out by rebel forces to \"draw attention to their cause\" ahead of the arrival of UN observers.\n\nDeputy Secretary-General of the UN, Jan Eliasson, called the alleged chemical attack 'shocking' and hopes the Syrian government will allow UN observers into the neighborhood as soon as possible.\n\n\"We see the need to investigate this as soon as possible; no matter what the conclusions, this represents a serious escalation with grave humanitarian and human consequences,\" said Eliasson who also added there is no confirmation that chemical weapons were used in Wednesday's bombing.\n\nA previous attempt by the UN to end the violence in Syria failed. In May of 2012, a UN convoy was hit by an IED (improvised explosive device) while a human rights group reported a Syrian military attack on civilians at a nearby funeral in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province. Later that year in August, a 300 person team left the country after their mandate expired, and was never renewed. Commander of the 2012 observation team General Babacar Gaye expressed frustration against both the Syrian armed forces and rebels for not allowing the UN to complete its mission.\n\n\"Initially the ceasefire was respected, violence decreased and we were able to do our work throughout the country, but by the middle of June it was clear that the parties were no longer committed to the ceasefire and the result has been an escalation in violence,\" said Gaye in 2012.\n\nThe UN's 2012 mandate was to; \"monitor a cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties and to monitor and support the full implementation of the Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the League of Arab States six-point-plan.\" Part of the plan included both sides working and cooperating with the UN special envoy, commitment to ceasing hostilities, and the Syrian army ceasing troop and tank movements against rebels in \"population centers\" throughout the country.",

    "original_text": "Politics and conflicts\nOn Tuesday, the Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis reasserted the openness of the EastMed project, which is aimed at connecting the Eastern Mediterranean gas fields with the European mainland via a pipeline through contested waters.\n\nIn his Tuesday live-streamed talk at the United States think tank Atlantic Council's Washington headquarters, Mitsotakis reaffirmed that the EastMed project, which currently involves Greece, Cyprus and Israel, is open for other countries to join. \"We don't seek to exclude anyone from energy cooperation in the Eastern Mediterranean provided they respect international law\", he said, repeating his January 2 remarks made on the EastMed signing ceremony.\n\nHe also commented on the Turkish-Libyan maritime border agreement, calling it \"null and void\" and \"geographically ridiculous\". \"The agreement assumes that our islands, including our biggest island Crete, does not have an exclusive economic zone, which goes against everything we know in international law\", he added. He also noted that the Libyan House of Representatives rejected the demarcation, and that Greece and Turkey might end up before International Court of Justice in the Hague if talks would fail. Mitsotakis underlined they keep channels to Turkey open for dialog and that he would be \"very-very happy if Turkey were to reconsider its overall approach\".\n\nLater on Tuesday Mitsotakis met with the International Monetary Fund, then with President Trump, where he denounced the border agreement again. In regard of clashing exclusive economic zone claims, he noted \"it is important to point out that the agreement signed between Turkey and Libya infringe upon Greece’s sovereign rights\". \n\nOn last Thursday, the delegations of Cyprus, Greece and Israel had met for their seventh trilateral summit, that time in Athens at the Zappeion Hall, to sign an agreement to construct the EastMed pipeline by 2025. The meeting was attended by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and energy minister Yuval Steinitz, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and energy minister Konstantinos Hatzidakis, and Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades and energy minister Georgios Lakkotrypis. The agreement was signed by the energy ministers. Greek daily Kathimerini said Greece and Cyprus had to speed up to counter possible Turkish interference with the project.\n\nEarlier that day, the Greek gas producer Energean signed a letter of intent on selling two billion cubic meters of gas per year to the Greek gas supplier DEPA. The planned pipeline capacity is 10 billion cubic meters per year. Energean has committed 1.7 billion dollars in the Karish and Tanin fields.\n\nWith this forming of political and economic alliance with Hellenic countries, Netanyahu envisioned the pipeline to end their \"fringe country\" status. Netanyahu called on Italy and Egypt to join the project, adding \"We call on any other country that wishes to join us to do so\". In Cyprus, the ruling Democratic Rally in Cyprus hailed the pipeline as an advancement in the nation's sovereignty. Progressive Party of Working People, the main opposition force, underlined that the agreement is only a legal framework, and actual construction is in the hands of still undecided private investors. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy underlined Turkish and Turkish Cypriot mining rights in the region, and projected a failure if these would be overlooked. \n\nOtranto, Italy is a proposed end point for the pipeline, and Italian economic development minister Stefano Patuanelli sent a letter of support prior to the signing, but the minister said they are to build another pipeline to Igoumenitsa, Greece. The United States expressed its support via the December 20 signing of the Eastern Mediterranean Bill, a July 25 quadrilateral meeting in Washington, and sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the trilateral meeting of EastMed countries on March 20 last year. The EU partially funded the feasibility studies, as it considers the EastMed pipeline to be a Project of Common Interest (PCI), ending the energy isolation of Crete and Cyprus, and diversifying the gas supply of Europe, when completed.\n\nIn December, a Turkish official said that the trans-Anatolian pipeline, which is already up and running, renders the EastMed building effort unnecessary, Cyprus Mail reported. On November 27, Turkey and Libya signed a maritime border agreement, according to which a section between Crete and Cyprus would cross the Turkish economic zone. Athens expelled the Libyan ambassador to Greece over this issue. Turkey maintains a position that only Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey, has the right to the exclusive economic zone around the island. Because of its drilling operations there, Turkey is already under EU sanctions, and was condemned in a joint statement by Egypt, Greece and Cyprus on October 8.\n\nIn 2017, a memorandum of understanding about the pipeline was signed between Cyprus, Greece and Israel.\n\nAccording to the Cyprus Mail, the 2000 km long pipeline is to connect the fields with Crete, the Greek mainland, and would end in Otranto, Italy. The May 2019 map of gas routes by Gas Infrastructure Europe draws the pipeline between the Aphrodite gas field and Thesprotia, Greece, where it merges with the Poseidon line en route to Italy.\n\nAlex Lagakos, deputy director of the Greek Energy Forum, said the project has a geopolitical significance rather than an economic one. He called it unlikely that the EU would finance the project, as it has committed itself to green energy. The estimated cost is six billion euros, but the saturation of the gas markets and competition from liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals are likely to keep private investors away, he noted. Egypt has two usable terminals in the Nile-Delta, in Damietta and Idku. On September 19, 2018, Cyprus and Egypt had signed an alternative deal to export Aphrodite gas through these ports via a new pipeline.\n\nHaifa University geostrategy expert and former Israeli security official, Avinoam Idan, said the new EastMed supply can't be considered a significant geopolitical change to Europe's energy market, as it would not affect the market share of Russian gas. In the analysis of the German Institute for Economic Research, the high costs and technical challenges render the project unrealistic.\n\nDuring the trilateral meeting of Cyprus, Greece and Israel on January 28, 2016, the then-envisioned EuroAsia Interconnector was considered as an alternative route to export the gas as electricity. The 1000 megawatt underwater cable connecting the three power grids is to be completed by December 2023. The estimated cost is 2.5 billion euros, and the EU considers it a PCI. EuroAfrica Interconnector, a similar project between Greece, Cyprus and Egypt, is also in its planning stage.",

It has become popularly known in France as the \"iPod bill,\" after the popular music player made by Apple Computer, and could pit France against Apple and other distributors of online music.\n\nThe National Assembly (lower house) and Senate (upper house) have passed two separate versions of the legislation. Both would reduce the penalties for piracy, require software companies to provide details on how their programs work, and create an agency that would have jurisdiction over digital copyright issues, including how often music can be legally copied by a customer for personal use and ensuring compatibility across devices.\n\nUnlike the Assembly version, the Senate version does not contain provisions that would require manufacturers such as Apple and Sony to open all music sold on their platforms to work on players other than their own. Currently, the stores for Apple and Sony sell music only for use on their own players. Critics of the changes say that the Senate's changes would defeat the purpose of the bill.\n\nThe two versions must now be reconciled in conference committee, a process that could take months.\n\nSpeaking in support of the bill, Assembly member Christian Paul said, \"We oppose the idea that the seller of a song or any kind of work can impose on the consumer the way to read it, forever, and especially in the consumer's home. Can we allow a couple of vendors to establish monopolies tightly controlling their clients and excluding competition?\"\n\nChristian Vanneste, the National Assembly sponsor of the iPod bill, said, \"In France, there are two distinct mentalities.

Rear Admiral Harry Harris, the commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo says some detainees were injured in \"the most violent outbreak\" at the facility since it was opened in 2002.\n\nOfficers fired rubber bullets at the detainees after the guards were attacked with \"broken light fixtures, fan blades\" and other improvised weapons. Rear Admiral Harris says, \"minimum force was used to quell the disturbance\".\n\nThe New York Times reports that a riot-control unit with batons and shields quelled Thursday’s disturbance. Another episode involved two other groups of inmates who tore apart their quarters and attacked guards.\n\nMilitary officials said the detainees' actions were designed to draw attention to the plight of the terror suspects detained indefinitely in \"Gitmo\". Rear Admiral Harris, said that a prisoner was pretending to hang himself to lure the guards into the room. \"The detainees had slickened the floor of their block with faeces, urine and soapy water in an attempt to trick the guards,\" he said. \"They then assaulted the guards with broken light fixtures, fan blades and bits of metal.\"\n\nThe guards used pepper spray and blasted the detainees with several shots from a shotgun, firing rubber balls during the five-minute fight. No guards were hurt, but six inmates were treated for \"minor injuries,\" he said.\n\nColonel Mike Bumgarner said guards shot five rounds of \"nonlethal\" pellets from a 12-gauge shotgun, and a rubber grenade from an M-203 launcher. He said rioting then broke out in two other blocks of Camp Four when around 50 detainees damaged their quarters and made weapons to attack the guards. Colonel Bumgarner said it took an hour to bring the disturbances under control. He says the six detainees received minor injuries.\n\nA military spokesman said 60 of the detainees were later transferred to more secure areas of the camp. Colonel Bumgarner says \"detainees were jumping out of the beds on top of the guards\" and some guards were knocked to the floor. \"Frankly we were losing the fight at that point,\" he said. \"This illustrates to me the dangerous nature of the men we have detained here,\" Rear Admiral Harris told reporters in a teleconference.\n\nEarlier in the day, two other detainees attempted suicide by overdosing on hoarded prescription drugs. Guantanamo officials said there have been 41 suicide attempts by 25 detainees and no deaths since the camp opened in January 2002. Defense lawyers contend the figure is higher.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nations Committee Against Torture has called on the United States to shut down Guantanamo and close any other \"secret prisons\" it operates. The UN declared the indefinite detention of suspects without charge a \"violation of the UN Convention Against Torture.\"\n\n\"The State party should cease to detain any person at Guantanamo Bay and close this detention facility, permit access by the detainees to judicial process or release them as soon as possible,\" the committee said. They called on the US to \"ensure that no one is detained in any secret detention facility under its de facto effective control\".",

An article published in this week's edition of Nature concludes that scientists might be able to distinguish small earthquakes from big ones by using the very first second of information contained in seismic waves.\n\nResearchers from the University of California, Berkeley, say the measurements of seismic waves soon after a trembler can signal whether it will be a minor or monster trembler. \"Basically, a high-pitched squeal means that you'll get a smaller quake. A low-groan means something bigger,\" says the University of California's Richard Allen.\n\nIn the study, Allen and colleagues analyzed records of 71 major Pacific Rim quakes in the past decades including 24 events that were greater than a magnitude 6. Using a mathematical model, they were able to estimate a quake's size to within one magnitude unit from as little as four seconds of data of the frequency of the energy in the primary wave. These low-energy waves typically cause a jolt, signaling the occurrence of a quake.\n\nAccording to a traditional theory, called the cascade model, we cannot know anything about an earthquake's ultimate magnitude until it is finished. This is because spread along a fault line depends on the stress in each individual part of the fault. Given that this information is not available to the initial rupture point, it should be impossible to tell from that first slip how far it will go or how long it will last.\n\nThe study by Berkeley's Allen and Erik L. Olson of the University of Wisconsin-Madison builds upon earlier work by Yutaka Nakamura in Japan. Nakamura's research indicated that the frequency of the P wave can allow prediction of which earthquakes will have a magnitude greater than 6 and distinguish them from small tremors that do not require warnings. Some fire stations use P wave detectors to automatically open doors in an effort to make sure that emergency vehicles are not trapped inside by doors that can be jammed shut by earthquake damage.\n\nThe goal of this research is to make the best possible use of the information from the earliest seismic waves emitted by an earthquake as part of an alert system to give seconds to tens of seconds of advance notice of an impending quake -- enough time for schoolchildren to take cover, power generators to trip off and valves to shut on pipelines. A major limitation of this work is that the greatest earthquake damage is near the epicenter where there is little time difference between the early P waves and the strongest damaging earthquake waves.\n\nThe second research paper, published this week in the scientific magazine Physical Review Letters, builds upon earlier research into patterns of earthquake activity at specific faults. The new research by scientists from Israel and Germany led by Prof. Shlomo Havlin, of Bar-Ilan University's Department of Physics in Israel, concerns prediction of the timing between earthquakes.\n\nProf. Havlin's research, in collaboration with Prof. Armin Bunde, of the Justus-Liebig University in Giessen, Germany, and Bar-Ilan University graduate student Valerie Livina, involved a large number of past earthquakes at many different faults. The data used in this study were for earthquakes ranging from magnitude 2 to magnitude 5.5 on the Richter Scale. Data were from several areas of the world including California, Japan, and New Zealand. The new results are consistent with previous studies which have indicated that some faults have more frequent small earthquakes while other faults have less frequent and larger earthquakes.",

    "original_text": "The African news website www.abarundi.org has accused Tanzania of being a state sponsor of terrorism, by helping Hutu-extremists in neighbouring Burundi to destabilise the country's newly-elected government. As widely predicted, Burundi's ruling \"Frodebu\" party, which has close links to Tanzania, was heavily defeated in this week's elections. The former Hutu rebel group CNDD-FDD, now a multi-ethnic party, won a convincing victory with 58% of the vote. Frodebu polled just 22%.\n\nIt was the first national democratic vote since 1993, when a military coup plunged Burundi into a decade-long, ethnically-charged civil war. During the election campaign, CNDD-FDD accused Frodebu of stirring up racial divisions, and of employing members of the Hutu-extremist FNL to kill and intimidate voters. The FNL rebels have remained outside the Burundian peace process, despite the restoration of democracy, and a series of heavy defeats by the Burundian army. On June 16th attackers believed to be members of the FNL massacred six churchgoers in the Muhuta district of Rural Bujumbura. During earlier local elections, the FNL had attacked a polling station, killing a United Nations peacekeeper, and killed several people in \"hit and run\" attacks on the Burundian capital Bujumbura. Frodebu denied involvement in the violence, but have recently admitted \"political collaboration\" with the FNL.\n\nwww.abarundi.org reports that the Tanzanian government has offered material support to the FNL leader and helped formalise the \"unholy alliance\" between Frodebu and the FNL:\n\n\"With the assistance of the Tanzanians, FNL leader Agathon Rwasa has moved his HQ from the hills around Bujumbura, where he was already in difficulty, to the Tanzanian capital Dar Es Salaam, where he can enjoy the protection of the Tanzanian secret service.\"\n\n\"Rwasa, who has nothing more to lose, has accepted that the success of the elections mean political death for the FNL, and their position as 'Hutu defenders' has become obsolete.\"\n\n\"But if Rwasa's strategy is merely his own survival, Frodebu's calculation is far more diabolical - they intend to perpetuate Burundi's bloody civil war and state of insecurity, in order to undermine the new institutions.\"",

Official results are set to be announced tomorrow at cyclenation.com.au because of a minor computer glitch. In a parallel youth competition run as part of the event, Zoe Cuthbert won the girls 10 and 11 year old three lap event.\n\nLast year's event was marred by rain, but this year the weather was ideal with no precipitation. First time on site, paramedics Theodora Magar and Chris Runcher reported no serious injuries, only a few minor cuts and bruises with the exception of one dislocated collar bone. They were backed up by other medical personnel located on the course. Events started at 7:00 a.m. at Sparrow Hill for the 100km race and and on through Canberra's downtown where the 50km started before going to the Black Mountain Reserve and the National Arboretum and ending at Mount Stromlo.\n\nCapital Punishment was part of a series of seven races organized by CycleNation which between 6,000 and 8,000 total riders participated in. There were a variety of cyclists of different skill levels including former Australian national team members, casual cyclists like Michael Courtney and Tracey Kloos alongside youth cyclists like Zoe Cuthbert. 40 year old Courtney traveled from Sydney to ride, finishing the 50km race in about 4 hours, 30 minutes but not setting a personal best. He enjoys riding in Canberra and finds the pain of going up the hills worth the ride down. Kloos also participated in the 50km race as a member of the 20 strong Newcastle women's based club, Newy Cogheads's Team Torque Talk. In her second time in the race, she did not set a personal best.\n\nOf the youth event, Cuthbert's father Paul said his first place finishing daughter regularly participated in mountain biking events, with the sport being her primary one though she does play netball casually. The eleven year old was celebrating her birthday on race day.\n\nOrganizer Theo Grobler said most cyclists would be done by 3:00 p.m. Canberra Time (5:00 UTC) and that some would need the eight hours to complete the 100km course.\n\nAnother 50km and 100km race, the Convict 100, will be held in Australia in the Sydney area next weekend on Saturday with a start time of 6:00 a.m. Sydney Time (20:00 UTC).",

The order, which is believed to be worth $15 billion, has given a boost to an otherwise disappointing Paris Air Show, which had been dominated by a state aid dispute between Airbus and Boeing.\n\nQatar Airways, which choose the Airbus A350 over Boeing's 787, will also purchase 20 of Boeing's larger 777 planes for $4.6 billion. Qatar has a previous order for 2 of Airbus' massive new A380's which it will begin to fly in 2009 out of London Heathrow.\n\nIn 2004, Airbus sold more planes than Boeing for the first time ever, sparking questions whether the US company had lost its once seemingly impregnable grip on the aviation market.

The FBI is investigating emails sent on this server, particularly any classified emails regarding the 2012 Benghazi attack that occurred on September 11, 2012 &amp;mdash; eleven years after 9/11 &amp;mdash; and left four US citizens dead.\n\nThe interview comes at a problematic time for Clinton as she is the favorite for Democratic Party nomination for US President at the 2016 Democratic National Convention which is set to take place at the end of July. Any indictment could alter the result of the Democratic National Convention's decision on a nominee, paving the way for other politicians such as Bernie Sanders to receive the nomination.\n\nBoth Clinton and the FBI have declined comment on the interview, but her spokesman Nick Merrill said Clinton is \"pleased to have had the opportunity to assist the Department of Justice in bringing this review to a conclusion.\" The Justice Department reportedly hopes to conclude the investigation before the Democratic Convention at the end of July.\n\nGOP lawmakers are suggesting a conflict of interest after United States Attorney General Loretta Lynch reportedly met with Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, on Lynch's plane at a Phoenix airport on Monday. This prompted Lynch to state on Friday she would accept the investigation's findings. Clinton and Lynch described it as a \"short chance meeting\" and \"exchange of pleasantries\". Lynch expressed her regret for the meeting, stating she \"certainly wouldn't do it again\". GOP lawmakers said the emails should be investigated by a third party, as they questioned the Department's impartiality.\n\nThe FBI is expected to conclude their investigation sometime before the convention on July 25.",

The majority of NHL clubs have lost money over the last five years and as a result the clubs wanted to cap pay at a set amount. The club owners would not go above $42.5 million for any one club, whilst the players refused to go below $49 million.

I will protect you as a parent, care for you as a brother and serve you as a son,” he continued. “As the king of a Buddhist nation, my duty is not only to ensure your happiness today but to create fertile ground from which you may gain the fruits of spiritual pursuit and attain good karma.”\n\n“As citizens of a spiritual land you treasure the qualities of a good human being — honesty, kindness, charity, integrity, unity, respect for our culture and traditions, love for our country and for God.”\n\nFollowing his speech, the new king handed out 20,000 commemorative coins to mark his new role in a country that did not have a currency until the 1960s.\n\nThe king that preceded Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck gave Bhutan many modern ideas, including democracy.

    "original_text": "Health\n\nResearchers at the University of Oxford, England, have published details of an improved method for growing cancer stem cells in the laboratory. They hope that the news will lead to faster progress in developing cancer treatment drugs.\n\nLearning how to tackle cancer stem cells is important for scientists because these cells may be the reason that tumours grow back after standard treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as they can self-replicate or develop into other cell types. Trevor Yeung, one of the researchers from the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, explained the importance of tackling cancer stem cells: \"It's like trying to weed the garden. It's no good just chopping off the leaves, we need to target the roots to stop the weeds coming back.\"\nsource=Trevor Yeung, University of Oxford\nThe approach until now has been to take samples of cancer from a patient, then improve the number of stem cells in each sample before seeing whether tumours were produced in mice. Not only was this a slow process, but the samples could only be used once. In the new method, details of which were published yesterday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, researchers have learned how to extract samples that have high numbers of cancer stems cells from bowel cancer cell lines (cells grown in a laboratory). Working with laboratory-grown cells enables drugs to be tested on them more quickly and repeatedly.\n\nThe research also showed that the proportion of cancer stem cells varies between bowel cancers, with more aggressive tumours having a higher proportion. It had previously been thought that cancer stem cells were only a small part of the cells within a tumour.\n\nSir Walter Bodmer, who led the study, said \"We can now evaluate anti-cancer drugs better to see whether they attack cancer stem cells. If you don't attack these cells, the cancer can grow out again.\" Yeung said \"If we could target treatments against these cells specifically, we should be able to eradicate cancer completely.\" He added that the research \"should allow the development of more useful, safe and specific drugs targeting cancer stem cells.\"\n\nBodmer, 74, is a former Director General of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. He was later Principal of Hertford College, Oxford, and has been a professor at Oxford as well as Stanford University. He was knighted in 1986.",

The bulge is located 25 miles outside of the city of Bend, Ore. and three miles from the South Sister.\n\nThe results of this years survey won't be available for some weeks, but geologists have come to some conclusions based on the past four years of monitoring. The intial discovery was made by using information from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Interferometric Satellite Aperture Radar satellite. Scientists believe the bulge is rising at a rate of 1.4 inches per year and is due to a large lake of fluid (likely magma) that is 4.5 miles below the surface. They also think the fluid covers an area about one mile across and extends to a depth of 65 feet. The pooling fluid could be shifting magma or the creation of a new volcano.\n\nGround swells aren't an extraodinary occurrence in geology. Geologists suspect that these ground swellings occur in the Cascade Range and at other volcanoes, and the majority of them do not lead to eruptions.

While all five were dug out by those who had not been buried, Waldner had already succumbed to the conditions, and his body was left by the group, fearing further slides; the body was recovered late Monday by search and rescue crews.

These claims were made after the Daily Mail described him as a \"sex-obsessed bigot and vile buffoon.\"\n\nZuma accused Britons of considering themselves to be culturally superior owing to their past colonial activities. \"When the British came to our country they said everything we did was barbaric, was wrong, inferior in whatever way. Bear in mind that I'm a freedom fighter and I fought to free myself, also for my culture to be respected. And I don't know why they are continuing thinking that their culture is more superior than others, those who might have said so,\" stated Zuma in an African newspaper.\n\nAccording to him, he had never \"looked down upon any culture of anyone\" and that no one has the authority of judging other cultures. Zuma added, \"The British have done that before, as they colonised us, and they continue to do this, and it's an unfortunate thing. If people want an engagement, I'm sure we will engage on that issue.\"\n\nThe President's comments were published in a local private newspaper. Zuma, who has three current wives, made these comments after arriving in Britain with Thobeka Madiba, 38, his third wife.\n\nThe Queen will welcome them at the Horse Guards Parade and take them to Buckingham Palace thereafter. A state banquet will also be held in his honor at the palace, where he is set to spend two nights.\n\nZuma, a member of the Zulu tribe, was compelled to make a public apology following a love child with the daughter of a friend. This incident triggered the articles in Daily Mail and Daily Mirror which attacked Zuma.\nsource=Jacob Zuma, President of South Africa\nZuma, whose state trip includes meetings with Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, as well as a speech to members of parliament, plans to continue with the visit. This was confirmed by officials today.\n\nVincent Magwenya, Zuma's spokesman said the incident would have no impact in Zuma's trip.\n\nMagwenya stated: \"Mr Zuma is in the UK for wide-ranging programme of substantial and serious issues. The comments he made were not aimed at the British public in general but at certain sections of the media which have lambasted him for what he considers to be his culture. Mr Zuma had a meeting with British journalists yesterday and was asked not one question about his private life\".\n\nHe also added that Zuma did not \"appreciate reading things which he considers are patronising to his culture\" and claimed that it was obvious that \"his comments will have no bearing on the state visit.\" The President, according to Magwneya, looks forward to the visit and will continue with the full schedule.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's principal opposition party, stated that the reports in the British newspapers did not warrant Zuma's lashing out at Britain.\n\nKenneth Mubu, of the opposing political party said, said: \"Instead of rising above predictable criticism from a particular quarter of the British press, he has allowed himself to be dragged down to the level of the tabloids. By accusing the British people of believing that Africans are barbaric and inferior, he has insulted his hosts, and no doubt undermined the entire purpose of the state visit – which is to strengthen relations between South Africa and the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThe youth sector of the African National Congress supported the President. It expressed its disgust at the British reports.\n\n\"British media seem to have developed a habit of rubbishing our president and constantly portray him as barbaric and of inferior belonging,\" the youth league said. \"It is quite apparent that the British media is the one that is characterised and defined by the worst form of barbarism, backwardness and racism. These British racists continue to live in a dreamland and sadly believe that Africans are still their colonial subjects, with no values and principles. They believe that the only acceptable values and principles in the world are British values of whiteness and subjugation of Africans,\" stated the party.",

    "original_text": "WikimediaMentionThe implosion of a relationship between Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales and journalist Rachel Marsden has resulted in controversy and international headlines. Associated Press and ABC News have also reported on questionable activity by Wales involving Wikimedia Foundation expenses. The Wikimedia Foundation is a donor-supported non-profit organization which runs Wikipedia.\n\nMarsden had contacted Wales two years ago about concerns she had over the article about her on Wikipedia, and Wales determined the article was not compliant with Wikipedia's standards. The tech blog Valleywag revealed Wales had a personal relationship with Marsden, and posted supposed transcripts of their instant message conversations on its site, www.valleywag.com. Wales and Marsden met in February, and The Times reported that \"An apparent transcript of their conversations before that meeting suggests that, although Mr Wales had withdrawn from the editing process, he was still influencing the editors.\" The Times quoted Wales from the chat logs as having stated to Marsden \"The truth is of course a much worse conflict of interest than that; but that will do.\" — in reference to his conflict of interest regarding Marsden's article on Wikipedia.\n\nWales posted a public statement on Saturday on Wikipedia addressing the matter, and stated that his relationship with Marsden was over: \"First, while I find it hard to imagine that anyone really cares about my sex life, the facts are: I am separated from my wife. I considered myself single at the time of my one meeting with Rachel Marsden on Feb. 9, 2008 ... I am no longer involved with Rachel Marsden. Gossipy stories suggesting that I have been in a relationship with her 'since last fall' are completely false ... I care deeply about the integrity of Wikipedia, and take very seriously my responsibilities as a member of the board and as a member of the Wikipedia community. I would never knowingly do anything to compromise that trust.\" With regard to the conflict of interest in Marsden's article, Wales had acknowledged to a team of Wikipedia editors in February 2008 that he and Marsden \"became friends ... and that we would be meeting about that,\" and stated \"I recused myself from any further official action with respect to her biography.\"\n\nOn Sunday, The Canadian Press reported that Marsden had posted photos of herself on Ebay, and was selling items that Wales had left at her New York City apartment. In her Ebay posting, Marsden stated: \"Hi, my name is Rachel and my (now ex-) boyfriend, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, just broke up with me via an announcement on Wikipedia ... It was such a classy move that I was inspired to do something equally classy myself, so I'm selling a couple of items of clothing he left behind, here in my NYC apartment, on eBay. Jimbo was supposed to come visit me in a couple of weeks and pick up some of his stuff, but obviously that won't be happening now.\" Marsden told The Canadian Press \"It didn't really help matters that Jimmy chose to announce the breakup to the entire world via Wikipedia (which apparently now is an online encyclopedia that doubles as a personal soapbox?) rather than to me directly (which he did much later, in an instant message discussion).\"\n\n4=Jimmy Wales\nMarsden placed a t-shirt and sweater which she said were left at her apartment by Wales up on Ebay, and started the bidding for each at ninety-nine cents, with the auctions set to end on March 12. By Monday, bidding on the t-shirt had reached US$300, and by Tuesday the highest bid had reached $12,200. In an email to The Globe and Mail, Marsden stated \"My only focus right now, to be really honest, is on my career and finding a way to get back into print, TV, or radio here in NYC,\" she wrote. \"All of this other personal stuff is just an unfortunate distraction.\"\n\nJay Walsh, the Wikimedia Foundation's head of communications, told the San Jose Mercury News that Wales' actions in relaying Marsden's concerns about her Wikipedia article to a team of trusted editors was within his \"routine\" role. When asked by the San Jose Mercury News if Wales' actions regarding the Marsden article could compromise his role with the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikipedia, Walsh responded \"No, absolutely not.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, ABC News carried a story by Wired News reporter Megan McCarthy regarding allegations of \"excessive spending\" by Wales, and Associated Press also reported on questions involving Wikimedia Foundation expenses. McCarthy reported that former Wikimedia executive Danny Wool, who had left the foundation last year, criticized Wales' use of Wikimedia Foundation expenses in a blog post. Wool stated that Wales had tried to expense $300 bottles of wine, a $1,300 dinner for four at a Florida steakhouse, and visits to Moscow massage parlors to the foundation, and that the foundation rescinded Wales' corporate credit card in 2006. Wool also stated that Wales paid the foundation $7,000, after being short $30,000 on receipts for expenses.\n\nWool told EPICENTER that \"There were occasions where he used the Wikimedia Foundation for personal advancement under the guide sic of the mission. And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful.\" Wool commented in an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle: \"Originally, it was carelessness ... But as things developed, it became more apparent and obvious that he was taking advantage of the foundation credit card. It was almost like his personal piggy bank.\"\n\n4=Sue Gardner\nIn an instant message exchange with Associated Press, Wales denied that the Wikimedia Foundation had taken away his corporate credit card, and asserted that he had made the decision to stop expensing business travel for the foundation. Wales highlighted a statement by the foundation's executive director Sue Gardner: \"Jimmy has never used Wikimedia money to subsidize his personal expenditures. Indeed, he has consistently put the foundation's interests ahead of his own.\" In an email to Associated Press, Brad Patrick, a former attorney for the Wikimedia Foundation, stated \"Danny seems interested in blogging his way straight to a lawsuit\".\n\nFlorence Devouard, who chairs the Wikimedia Foundation, told Associated Press that Wales had been \"slow in submitting receipts,\" and that the foundation had rejected Wales' expense at the Florida steakhouse. Devouard told fellow foundation board members in a private email that she had convinced Associated Press that \"the money story was a no story,\" and told Wales \"I find (it) tiring to see how you are constantly trying to rewrite the past. Get a grip!\" Wales told Associated Press: \"The board, the current executive director, the previous executive director, and independent auditors have reviewed our books and publicly agree that all of my expenses were appropriate and fully accounted for.\"\n\nMedia reports speculated on how the controversy would end up being represented in Wikipedia itself. On Wednesday, the St. Petersburg Times wrote: \"Wales' Wikipedia page said only this about Marsden: 'Wales had a brief relationship with Canadian journalist Rachel Marsden.'\" An article in The Australian surmised: \"History will decide whether Mr Wales broke his own principles, but before that happens there may well be a Wikipedia page devoted to the controversy.\"",

    "original_text": "Research published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B on Wednesday by Albert Le Floch and Guy Ropars of French University of Rennes claims dyslexia may be caused by the way the photoreceptors in dyslexic individuals' eyes are arranged. Co-author Ropars said, \"Our observations lead us to believe that we indeed found a potential cause of dyslexia\".\n\nIn dyslexic individuals, the pattern of photoreceptors in the right eye is similar to that on the left and produces a \"mirror image\", while in non-dyslexic individuals, there are two different patterns in the two eyes, researchers found in their study. Individuals with dyslexia have difficulty reading, especially distinguishing between letters that are mirror images of each other, like the characters 'b' and 'd' or 'p' and 'q'.\n\nIn the back of the eye, there is a site called the fovea which contains cone cells, of three kinds responding either to red, green, or blue light. In one patch within the fovea, there are cone cells for red and green but none for blue. In the dominant eye, with greater connectivity to the brain, this spot was found to be round while in the other eye, it was asymmetrical. This, researchers speculate, allows the brain to choose just one of the two images to work with. The researchers observed the dyslexic individuals have round spots in both eyes, which produces mirror images, and the brain can not decide which one to consider.\n\n\"For dyslexic students their two eyes are equivalent and their brain has to successively rely on the two slightly different versions of a given visual scene,\" the researchers said. According to Ropars, this may also serve as a means of diagnosing dyslexia.\n\nUsing an LED lamp, researchers observed images from the two eyes do not reach the hemispheres of the brain at the same time, with there being a delay of about ten thousandths of a second. The researchers were able to use a flashing LED light, which was flashed at high frequency that it became invisible to the observer's eye to allow the study participants to process only one image by \"cancelling\" one of the two produced in each eye.\n\nResearch participants called this LED light the \"magic lamp.\" Ropars said more testing is to be done to confirm this technique's efficacy in treating dyslexia.",

Police called in extra officers and asked people to stay off the street when the Itaipu hydroelectric plant failed at 10:15 pm local time Tuesday (0015 GMT Wednesday) and plunged the affected areas into darkness.\n\nThe electric plant supplies the regions of Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Goiás, Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, and Espírito Santo, as well as 90% of neighbouring Paraguay, which was almost completely without power for fifteen minutes. Brazilian Energy Minister Edson Lobao stated that the cause of the \"complete paralysis\" of the plant was not yet known, but put forward a theory that lightning may have caused the high-tension supply lines to short out.\n\nAlthough this is not the first time that Brazil has had power outages, with severe loss of electricity in 2001, 2005 and 2007, radio station Bandnews estimated that 50 million people&amp;mdash;a quarter of Brazil's population&amp;mdash;were affected, one of the largest outages in recent history.\n\nA few hours after the power cut, the hydroelectric plant came back on line and the affected regions gradually regained power, allowing the areas in chaos caused by lack of traffic lights and power to underground railways to return to normal, and residents to put out their candles.",

Bush. It was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two individuals forcibly removed from a presidential 'Town Hall Meeting', and has brought to light a White House manual detailing tactics aimed at suppressing demonstrations and barring those identifiably opposed to Bush Administration policy access to presidential events.\n\nLeslie Weise, Karen Bauer and Alexander Young, all of Colorado, and often referred to as 'The Denver Three' were ejected from the March 21, 2005 presidential 'Town Hall Meeting' billed as 'A Conversation on Social Security' after it was discovered that their vehicle displayed a bumper sticker reading 'no blood for oil'.\n\nWeise and Young filed an earlier lawsuit against two volunteers at the event for their collaboration with an unidentified man who has been charged with impersonating a US Secret Service agent while ejecting them. This case is now in the hands of the Justice Department.\n\nThe 2002 manual titled the 'Presidential Advance Manual' from the 'Office of Presidential Advance' bears the Presidential Seal, and is marked 'sensitive'. Its dissemination was restricted to the Executive Office of the President, White House Military Office and the Secret Service. A heavily redacted version of the once secret manual was released under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe non-redacted parts of the manual detail strategies designed to suppress demonstrations and bar those identifiably opposed to Bush Administration policy access to presidential events.\n\nThe manual advises local Republicans, who are charged with filling such events, to form 'Rally Squads' from \"college/young republican organizations, local athletic teams, and fraternities/sororities\". A section titled Preventing Demonstrators (sic) directs: \"The rally squad's task is to use their signs and banners as shields between the demonstrators and the main press platform. If the demonstrators are yelling, rally squads can begin and lead supportive chants to drown out the protesters (USA! USA! USA!) As a last resort, security should remove the protesters from the event site.\" Another part urges: \"It is important to have your volunteers at a checkpoint before the Metal Detectors in order to stop a demonstrator from getting into the event.\"\n\nChris Hansen a senior ACLU attorney and lead counsel for the case remarked \"The White House has gone too far in its attempt to make dissent invisible,\" \"When taxpayers foot the bill for a public event, the president does not have the right to use a partisan litmus test to stack the audience with his political supporters.\"",

    "original_text": "An Australian terrorism expert says he has evidence, which could show Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden is either seriously ill or dead.\n\nProfessor Clive Williams, director of terrorism studies at the Australian National University, says he has been provided with evidence, by an Indian colleague, to support the theory that bin Laden died of massive organ failure in April last year.\n\nProfessor Williams says Ayman al Zawahiri, bin Laden's deputy, has been making all statements on behalf of Al Qaeda for around a year.\n\nAl Zawahiri is believed to have been the target of a strike in Pakistan last week which killed at least 18 people in a remote Pakistani tribal village, the second such unexplained attack near the volatile Afghan border within a week.\n\nHowever, Professor Williams says it may be impossible to ever prove if Osama bin Laden, accused of plotting the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon building in the U.S., is alive or dead.\n\n\"It's hard to prove or disprove these things because there hasn't really been anything that allows you to make a judgement one way or the other,\" he said. \"But it does seem strange that Dr Zawahiri has been making all of the statements since then, and nothing's been heard from Bin Laden since I think the December of the year before.\"\n\nHe says even if bin Laden was dead, it would not make much difference - as people would continue to fight for the things they believe he stood for. He has also recommended against confirming his death or otherwise.\n\nProfessor Williams, the Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre said the information, which came from a former Indian intelligence officer whom he would not identify, was credible but impossible to confirm.\n\n\"It does seem reasonably convincing based on the evidence that I've been provided with that he's certainly either severely incapacitated or dead at this stage,\" Dr Williams said.\n\nBut he said, \"Even if he's dead, it will be almost impossible for Western authorities to prove it. It may simply be that we don't hear much about Bin Laden again ... or he may pop up again in six months' time and make a new statement, at which case, of course, we will go back to Square1.\"\n\nAl-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's actions in targeting Shi'ites in Iraq were another factor raising doubt that bin Laden was still leading al-Qaeda. Bin Laden had promoted a pan-Islamic vision and had tried, unsuccessfully, to attract Shi'a Muslims to al-Qaeda.\n\n\"From what I have read, Zarqawi had a great deal of respect for bin Laden, so it would seem unlikely that he would be doing that if bin Laden was still around,\" said Williams. There was also the question of how long an ill man like bin Laden, who walked with a cane and suffered from a kidney disease, would survive in the tribal areas of Pakistan, where he was thought to be hiding.\n\nHowever, the United States believes Bin Laden still alive. Osama Bin Laden and his deputy are thought to be living in the area of a missile strike apparently aimed at Ayman al-Zawahiri, said US counter-terrorism ambassador Henry Crumpton. He said the al-Qaeda leader and his number two were believed to be in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region.\n\nThe US has not commented on the attack on a Pakistan village on Friday that killed 18 civilians. US media said the attack was carried out by the CIA. Thousands of Pakistanis later staged anti-American demonstrations.",

    "original_text": "ScientologyDavid S. Touretzky, prominent free speech activist and critic of Scientology, discussed his opinions on the recent Internet backlash against the Church of Scientology in an interview with former Scientologist and Wikinews reporter Nicholas Turnbull. The recent conflict on the Internet between critics of Scientology and the Church has been spurred on in declarations by a nebulous Internet entity using the name Anonymous that the Church of Scientology \"will be destroyed\". Anonymous has directed recent protests at Scientology centres across the world, which have attracted significant numbers of individuals supporting the cause. In recent e-mail correspondence with Wikinews, a representative of the Church of Scientology declared that the Church considers the activities of Anonymous to be illegal, and that Anonymous \"will be handled and stopped\".\n\nTouretzky, a research professor in artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience at Carnegie Mellon University, has been a prominent critic of the Church of Scientology since mid-1995, and has been protesting against Scientology vociferously since then; he has also run websites that publish material that Scientology wishes to keep suppressed from the public eye, such as extracts from Scientology's formerly-confidential Operating Thetan (OT) materials. Touretzky views the actions of the Church of Scientology as being \"a threat to free speech\", and has endured harassment by the Church of Scientology for his activities.\n\nThe Church of Scientology continues to suffer damage to its public reputation through increased exposure on the Internet and vocal protests by Scientology critics such as Prof. Touretzky. A recent event that focused intense attention on Scientology's totalitarian attitude was the leak of an internal Church of Scientology propaganda video to the Internet video sharing site YouTube, in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise spoke heavily in Scientology's jargon and stated that that \"we Scientology are the authorities\" on resolving the difficulties of humanity. The declaration of war by Anonymous followed shortly after this leak, in the form of a video posted to the Internet.\n\nThe ongoing dispute, cast by some as Scientology versus the Internet, brought Scientology terms such as \"SP\" (Suppressive Person, an enemy of Scientology) and \"KSW\" (Keeping Scientology Working) into general usage by non-Scientologists from the late 1990s onwards; increased attention has been drawn to Scientology by the release of the Cruise video in addition to media coverage. This focus has caused an even greater propagation of these terms across the outside world, as Touretzky comments in the interview.\n\nWikinews asked Prof. Touretzky about the impact that the activities of Anonymous will have on Scientology, the public relations effect of the Tom Cruise video, the recent departure of individuals from the Church of Scientology's executive management, the strategies that Anonymous will employ and Touretzky's experiences of picketing the Church.\n\ninterview\n\nWikinews (Nicholas Turnbull): How deep do you think the impact of the Anonymous protests and Internet action will be on Scientology’s cashflow?\n\n:Prof. David S. Touretzky: Anonymous will not have any effect on Scientology gross income. Their stats statistics are already in the basement. The only folks left are hardcore true believers who think the Intertubes are full of criminals. What Anonymous might do is increase the pressure on Hollywood celebs to distance themselves from the cult. There was a really good article yesterday about how Anonymous is morphing… changing from hackers or pranksters to a legitimate social protest movement.\n\nWN: Yes, indeed... the movement seems to be taking a different sort of shape from just a load of pranksters to a proper, organised protest. So your basic opinion regarding the impact on Scientology's stats is that they are already too low, and failing, for the damage to be significant?\n\n:DT: That's my view, yes. But that's only one kind of damage. There are several other kinds of damage that may be significant. One is to warn off Hollywood celebs from cozying up to the cult, like Kimora Lee Simmons was just caught doing. And Will Smith too. A second kind of damage has to do with Scientology's attempts to make inroads into civilized society, specifically government programs and local schools.\n\nWN: Presumably this would be, in part, because the celebs wouldn't want to sully their own PR public relations image.\n\n:DT: Yes, the celebs have agents and PR people who will tell them in no uncertain terms to stay away from those crazy Scientologists or risk alienating their fan base. It must be difficult to be a Tom Cruise fan right now. What can you say when your idol publicly steps in dog poo and insists it's spun gold?\n\nWN: Quite... the leaked video was quite possibly worse than the Oprah fiasco for his reputation, I think.\n\n:DT: \"Tom Cruise is batshit crazy\" has entered the national lexicon, along with \"SP\", \"KSW\", and \"We are the authorities\". Yeah, that line \"We are the authorities\" is priceless.\n\nWN: Yes, indeed; it has now become part of popular culture and the “blogosphere” has gone crazy over it.\n\n:DT: There's one more thing I hope Anonymous can accomplish, and that is to shift the focus from Xenu and BTs “body thetans”, souls said to be attached to a person in Scientology’s secret “OT III” teachings to disconnection, fair game, fraud, and barratry. Did you know that DM's David Miscavige, the current leader of Scientology’s niece is appearing on Inside Edition tonight?\n\nWN: I didn't know that she was appearing on Inside Edition, actually. I must catch that.\n\n:DT: She has nothing to do with Chanology the recent anti-Scientology movement that has gathered on Internet message boards, but what we're seeing here is a \"perfect storm\" of entheta material considered negative by Scientology. It's all coming together in a chain reaction: The Tom Cruise video, Andrew Morton's bio, Kirstie Alley's craziness, Kimora Lee Simmons, Jenna Miscavige, and there's more to come!\n\nWN: I believe the things like disconnection, fair game, the RPF Rehabilitation Project Force, a Scientology penal system within the paramilitary Sea Org etc. are all more captivating to the hearts and minds of the general public than Xenu... so do you think that the Church of Scientology will ever be able to recover from this blow to their reputation? In other words, will this be the \"beginning of the end\" of the Church seriously being able to promote themselves to the general public?\n\n:DT: I've learned it's impossible to predict what will happen next with CoS the Church of Scientology. We try, but we always get it wrong. They have capabilities for self-destructive behavior that far exceed those of normal individuals. Now that Mike Rinder has blown, anything is possible. And he's not the only exec out there who has a gripe with DM.\n\nWN: Indeed. There have been many high-profile blows departures from upper exec executive strata and I wonder how many more the CoS can cope with.\n\n:DT: Yes, these folks are starting to go public. John Peeler has already done so. And who could have predicted Jenna Miscavige would turn SP? Amazing!\n\nWN: A further question, if I may, regarding the impact on Scientology: do you think that the recent activities of Anonymous will have a profound effect on the Sea Org hierarchy and possibly make it harder for the Church of Scientology to continue maintaining their PR image to their own staff members? Could this trigger a massive series of \"blows\" from the Sea Org?\n\n:DT: You're probably in a better position as a former member to assess the affect on Sea Org members, but my guess is that they won't even be aware of Anonymous actions, or will write them off as crazy Internet hatemongers. I think a bigger impact will come from Jenna Miscavige leader David Miscavige's niece.\n\nWN: What exactly is Anonymous going to do on the 10th? Are their intentions peaceful?\n\n:DT: Oh yeah, they appear to be *very* concerned about avoiding any kind of violence or unlawful behavior. From what I can see, they understand that any kind of violence or criminality would play into CoS' hands. It would allow CoS to portray themselves as victims and score a PR win. One anonymous person suggested that the policy towards all participants should be: \"If you do anything illegal, WE will call the cops on you ourselves.\"\n\nWN: What is your opinion on the reverse: do you think the CoS will be peaceful and legal in its handling of \"Anonymous\"? In a recent e-mail exchange with Wikinews, a Scientology staff member said that Anonymous would be \"handled and stopped\" and that the actions \"have been reported\". Will Scientology carry out its usual harassment, or do you think that it has learned its lesson that such abusive tactics cause more of a backlash?\n\n:DT: My best guess is that the Scientologists will employ their famous \"hiding tech\". Doors locked, lights off, and PIs private investigators discreetly filming from a distance.\n\nWN: I imagine the CoS will attempt their usual approach of trying to turn it into a pro-Scientology rally, as they have done at many smaller pickets, although I feel that it would fail miserably.\n\n:DT: I was at the pickets in 1997 (twice) and 1999. They tried counter-picketing. They tried harassing us and getting in our faces. Even physically harassed a woman with a seeing eye dog. But eventually they switched to hiding tech. I also did a solo picket on L. Ron Hubbard Way, and they kept trying different ways to \"handle\" me. I was only planning on spending an hour there, but I was having so much fun I didn't quit ‘till it got too dark to see. I thought about running out to buy a flashlight, but decided to call it a day. My feet were sore!\n\nWN: laughs So it sounds like you had quite a day of it, Dave.\n\n:DT: Yes, I have fond memories of that day. For me, it was like going to Disneyland and seeing Mickey Mouse.\n\nWN: What have been your most effective tactics against the CoS, then, Dave, in terms of impact and education of others?\n\n:DT: The web sites are probably the most effective, but doing radio and TV appearances has also been pretty helpful. I've done over 20 radio interviews and three national TV appearances, two of which were on Keith Olbermann's show. I was gonna say: there's a reason Scientology felt it necessary to counterpicket us in Clearwater.\n\nWN: Presumably because of the public exposure?\n\n:DT: It has nothing to do with the public. It's because they don't want to appear powerless in front of their members. It was a face-saving gesture. But it didn't work out the way they'd hope. The public will drive by a picket, honk their horn, and forget about it by time they turn the corner. But the members see their cult being publicly mocked by a bunch of SPs, that makes a deep impression. Especially when there are signs about Lisa McPherson's death, or t-shirts containing the text of OT III.\n\nWN: Indeed, as their PTS/SP Potential Trouble Source/Suppressive Person handling tech technology needs to be seen to be \"working\" at least to Scientologists.\n\n:DT: So they sent out their members to counter-picket us as a way to make them feel better, but it didn't work. The members behaved badly, and at some level they must have known they were being jerks. So forget about confronting suppression. The new tech is \"lock doors, douse lights, and whine as loudly as you can!\" My suggested picket sign for large Orgs: \"Mike Rinder Blew. You Can Too!\". Rinder appeared in a tuxedo at past IAS International Association of Scientologists events. They know who he is.\n\nWN: I would have thought that Scientologists hiding from critics’ protests to be \"non-confront\" refusing to face up to something in the Scientologists' own doctrine; although they would see it, I suppose, as \"cutting entheta comm\" refusing to engage in negative communication.\n\n:DT: Yeah, I don't know how they explained the strategy switch to their members, but your suggestion sounds right to me.\n\nWN: In your experience in pickets, has the \"Why are you here? Ok, right. So why are you really here? Hehehe, no... why are you *really* here?\" bullbaiting of protesters been killed off?\n\n:DT: My last picket was in 1999. I imagine, with so many sites being picketed this time, we'll see a variety of strategies. But bullbaiting picketers was never very successful. For the 1998 solo picket my sign had two sides. One side said \"Doubt is not a crime. Freedom is not a stat.\" The other side said \"RTC: who crashed gross income?\" That one drove them ape. I didn't fully appreciate why that sign would upset them so much, until some ex-member explained it to me: it was a call for a witch-hunt.\n\nWN: I think that kind of stratagem is probably going to be the most effective, because the Scientologists themselves can identify with such things; perhaps it may well be that it touches enough of a raw nerve in their own world, as it were, to give them pause for thinking. Is Scientology losing it grip on maintaining its \"Wizard of Oz\" world whereby its staff consider the tech to be infallible and the orgs to be clearing the planet?\n\n:DT: Yes, the members must be having huge doubts by now. But there remains a hardcore of followers who will not look at critical materials. I'd put them in two categories. First are the old timers who never got the whole Intertubes thing the Internet. The second class is younger folk who are just losers. Not bright or intellectually curious. Maybe ex-addicts who ended up joining staff. They're not going to go surfing the web for entheta, any more than Tom Cruise would.\n\nWN: Quite... there were very few \"Founding Scientologists\" in my day, largely because the purge in the 1980s had cleared most of the remaining ones out, and the remainder had left in disgust following \"hard ethics\" severe disciplinary procedures.\n\n:DT: Yeah, and DM has done his best to alienate whoever was left. … DM has been a disaster for Scientology.\n\nWN: Well, Dave, thank you so much for answering my questions, you've given an interesting perspective on all this.\n\n:DT: My pleasure, Nicholas.\n\nWN: In closing: how long do you think Scientology has got?\n\n:DT: I think they're looking at a major contraction in the next two years. But they may linger on, a mere shadow of their former ominous selves, for decades.\n\nWN: Thank you so much, again. You've been wonderful, and it has been a pleasure talking with you.",

Auckland replaces Fiji as the hosts following their coup last year.\n\nThe decision was announced by the International Federation of Netball Associations (IFNA) and the Netball New Zealand Board (NNZ). President of the IFNA, Molly Rhone, said: \"IFNA would like to thank both Auckland and Christchurch for their offers and welcome Auckland as the new host of 12th World Netball Championships in New Zealand.\"\n\nGarry Moore, mayor of Christchurch, said that it is disappointing for Christchurch to not have gained the hosting rights, but is still proud of the bid they made in the very short time frame they were given. \"I want to congratulate Auckland and wish them all the very best in what will be a very exciting time in the City of Sails.\" Mr Moore has called for support for Auckland, and has said that Christchurch will still benefit financially from Auckland having the hosting rights, as well as New Zealand as a whole. He gives his luck to Auckland for a successful Championships.\n\nThe Netball World Championships, which happens every four years, will be held between 10 November and 17 November later this year, later than originally planned so the hosts and venues can be better prepared. The games will be played at Trusts Stadium, Waitakere, Auckland and the semi-finals and final may be played at Vector Arena, if it has been completed.\n\nBob Harvey, mayor of Waitakere, said that he expects millions of dollars to be put into the local economy because of the Championships. Mr Harvey said the council put NZ$50,000 into their bid to host the Championships and has set aside $70,000 for the hosting of the games. Mr Harvey said that he is delighted that the region has managed to secure the hosting rights, and expects Vector Arena to be completed in time to host the semi-finals and final.\n\nDon Mackinnon, NNZ Board Chair, said: \"We’re grateful to the Venues who worked with their City Councils and Netball communities in preparing these offers, and congratulate Auckland on their successful proposal.\"\n\nDick Hubbard, mayor of Auckland City, is pleased that the hosting rights were given to Auckland, the \"home to 25,630 registered netball players.\" \"Auckland City recognises the hugely important role netball plays in our community and is excited about showing our passion for the game to the world.\" Mr Hubbard said that the Championships will also provide a good start for Auckland in the lead up to the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\n\nRuth Aitken, coach of New Zealand's netball team, Silver Ferns, said that it will be good for her players that the Championships are being held in Auckland. She said that playing at home is a wonderful opportunity.\n\nMr Mackinnon has announced that a new organisation will be formed to help with the preparation of the Championships, along with the work NNZ has already done.\n\nMs Rhone, said that it was major benefit for the Championships that NNZ was willing to make the dates and venues final so quickly, as it means that preparation can now get started for the venues and the 16 participating netball teams.\n\n\"Running a world class event in a compressed timeframe will be a challenge, but with the support of the Auckland community, we know that New Zealand will be able to host an excellent World Netball Championships,\" Mr Mackinnon said.\n\nMr Mackinnon said that he and NNZ are looking forward to hosting the championship, which he described as the pinnacle event of Netball.\n\nOne of the reasons that Christchurch did not gain the hosting rights this year might have been because in 1999, Christchurch hosted the event.",

According to her coach she was \"crying for about two hours.\" Her coach compared the decision to \"finding out that a close relative has died.\"\n\nThe deadline to register for five of the seven would-be Iraqi Olympians has passed. However, if the National Olympic Committee of Iraq is reinstated, the possibility exists that its two sprinters may be able to compete, if they register before the track and field deadline at the end of July.",

The UltraSPARC T1 is available with four, six or eight cores, each able to work on four threads at a time. The concept is similar to that of the Intel Pentium EE which uses two cores with two threads.\n\nA multicore processor is like having many CPUs on the one chip. Multiple threads allow each core to work on a number of tasks concurrently on a single core. This is particularly useful in a server environment where the UltraSPAC T1 was designed to be used.\n\nSun call the open source version of their processor the OpenSPARC T1 and have made the source code (in Verilog format) and specifications available on the OpenSPARC T1 website under the General Public License, the same license under which most distributions of Linux are released.\n\nIndustry observers say that the move is triggered by the SPARC architecture's shrinking market share to the likes of IBM's POWER architecture and x86 based chips from Intel and AMD.\n\nOpen Source Hardware has been gaining momentum since 2002, when Kofi Annan issued a challenge to technology companies. Despite Sun's OpenSPARC T1 not being the first open source processor in the world, it is the first time that the design for a proprietary design processor has been released to the open source community.",

    "original_text": "A 21-year-old Swedish man killed himself and broadcast it over the internet via his webcam feed Monday, after posting to a message board that he had swallowed some painkillers and was going to hang himself.\n\nAt 11:51 a.m. Central European Summer Time (0951 UTC), Marcus Jannes, a student from Järna, Stockholm, posted to the Mental Health Problems forum of Sweden's Flashback message boards using the newly-registered username \"LurifaxFlux\", stating that he was going to hang himself, adding that he had already swallowed 100mg of dexofen and 1500mg of paracetamol. He said that he had set up a webcam to record the event, and would post details later of a FTP server for people to watch.\n__NOTOC__\nPeople responded to his post almost immediately. Some offered messages of hope, such as, \"How bad can it be? When everything is at its worst, it can only get better\", and \"Think of poor people, mutilated people, people who are lame or blind. Living with a disability is hard. They can not change their lives! But you still have the ability to alter yours!\" Others tried to keep him online by talking to him empathetically: \"Is there anything that can make you change your mind?\", \"Tell me about yourself.\"\n\nHowever, other users posted messages saying they didn't believe him, wishing him luck with his attempt, and calling him an attention whore and a troll. They also goaded him by saying, \"you won't dare, you are too cowardly\", and offering advice on the best way to hang himself: \"I recommend ... you do it from a height that you can jump off so you are guaranteed to break your neck.\"\n\nIn a later post, Jannes said that he had been feeling suicidal for about six months, but was too scared to actually attempt anything until he tried to strangle himself with his own hands. In response to questions, he stated that he was using a network cable to strangle himself because he didn't have any rope, but he was worried that the cable would not be strong enough to take his weight. He also told them that he had Asperger syndrome and High-functioning autism, and was emotionally vulnerable and lacked normal social skills. He admitted to feeling lonely, and alluded to experiencing problems at school, but admitted that he had a good upbringing and had a rather good life. At around the same time, he also updated his Facebook status to say life was \"just too difficult\", and that he was going to kill himself.\n4=Marcus Jannus\n\nA short while later, at 1:06 p.m., Jannus posted the FTP server URL and login details, and stated that he needed to hurry up because, \"I'm beginning to feel that I might change my mind.\" At this point, people who logged on to the server found a series of still images taken every two seconds, showing a young man dressed in sweatpants and t-shirt, in his apartment, hanging network cable from a doorway.\n\nAt 1:13 p.m., the images show that Jannus stepped out of the shot, and at this point he posted another message to Flashback. \"Alright, let's do it,\" he said. The next series of images show him walking back to the cable and hooking it around his neck. He slumps to the floor, and his body begins shaking while his head and arms turn dark purple until he stops moving. His skin color then lessens to a pink-red shade as his limp body hangs motionless for a number of minutes.\n\nOn the message board, people start to realize the seriousness of the events: \"Given the last pictures, it looks like this was serious\", \"holy crap, he has done it already\", \"okay it's getting nasty\", \"this is quite sick. Not okay at all,\" and \"I've seen a lot online but this is the worst I've seen in my entire life\" were some of the comments posted. At 1:32 p.m., a user asks, \"Did someone call the police?\".\n\nThe Södertälje police state that they were first alerted to the incident at 1:44 p.m. At 2:06 p.m., the image feeds show two police officers charging into the apartment and releasing the cable from around Jannus' neck. They begin administering CPR. Two minutes later, two paramedics arrive, and they take over CPR while one of the officers looks around the room at cables; the back of a flat-screen television set; and presumably the computer, as the images finally stop being uploaded.\n\nSödertälje Polisen spokesperson Lotta Thyni confirmed that Jannus had died. \"The police performed CPR until paramedics arrived on the scene, but his life could not be saved.\"\n\nThe police have so far declined to comment on how the suicide will be investigated, but Sven-Erik Alhem, a chief prosecutor in Sweden told Aftonbladet, that psychologically inducing a person to commit suicide, or contributing to the act, can be classified as incitement to murder, and is a criminal offense.\n\nThe \"Hängning\" thread at Flashback continued to receive new posts until the thread was locked by a site moderator at 5:27 p.m. It had received a total of 630 posts over 53 pages. \"It is unfortunate if someone knew that the man planned to kill himself and did not do anything to stop him,\" said Thyni, but added that police can not control how people use social forums on the web. \"They lack empathy\".\n\nThe Flashback message boards are a controversial topic in Sweden. They are seen as being similar to the English language website 4chan, and especially its \"Random\" /b/ board. The Flashback members are able to post with a great amount of freedom of speech. The site has been investigated by the Swedish police on numerous occasions and is under constant surveillance by the Swedish Security Service due to its members' abundant discussions about drug use, child pornography, race science, bestiality and other controversial subjects. Other controversies include sexual harassment of celebrities and politicians, open racism, forced disconnection from its internet service provider, the hosting of nazi sites, and the sabotage of telephone votes in TV shows.\n\n\"I do not remember such a situation in Sweden before,\" says Anders Ahlqvist from the Swedish national police force. A similar incident occurred in Sweden in 2008, when Oscar Ores Balingen, 34, from Stockholm attempted to kill himself online. In that case, the police were able to reach Balingen before he died, and managed to save his life. \"People said that I would not dare, but it made me only more triggered,\" Balingen told Aftonbladet. \"I do not think they are taking the threats seriously. There is a terrible lack of empathy on these forums.\"\n\nIn November 2008, a 19-year-old male from Pembroke Pines, Florida used his webcam to broadcast his suicide on the live video site Justin.tv. Abraham K. Biggs, 19, committed suicide by taking an overdose of opiates and benzodiazepine, which had been prescribed for his bipolar disorder. He also made online threats of suicide and advertised his intentions to broadcast it live over the internet.",

In the speech Mr. Bush discussed the surge in Iraq. He said, \"Over the past year, we the US government have seen significant security gains result from the surge.\"\n\nBush also claimed that the United States had achieved many things in Iraq. He stated that \"the military achievements in Iraq have been accompanied by a political transformation. It can feel like distant history, but it was only five years ago that Iraq was one of the most brutal dictatorships on Earth - a totalitarian nightmare where any election was a sham, and dissenters often found themselves buried in mass graves. In a matter of 15 months, the Iraqi people reclaimed their sovereignty. They went on to choose an interim government, and to ratify the most democratic constitution in the Arab world. And in December 2005, 12 million Iraqis elected a government under that constitution - a display of courage that defied the terrorists, disproved the critics, and should always inspire the world.\"\n\nHe continued, saying that, \"Tragically, the democratic progress in Iraq threatened to unravel in 2006. The new government Iraqis elected took months to form. In the meantime, a terrorist attack on a Shia shrine in Samarra drove sectarian tensions past the breaking point. Sunni extremists, including al Qaeda terrorists, and Shia extremists, some backed by Iran, slaughtered innocent Iraqis in brutal attacks and reprisal killings. And across the country, political and economic activity was set back.\"\n\nPresident Bush did, however, say that the US coped well with the situation in Iraq. \"We took a hard look at the situation, and responded with the surge. This dramatic shift in policy had two primary goals. The first was to improve security conditions. So I ordered 30,000 additional soldiers and Marines into Iraq, and gave them a new mission, to focus on protecting the Iraqi people, and to hold the gains that had been made,\" he said.\n\nImage:George Bush - March 27, 2008 (2).jpg\nImage:George Bush - March 27, 2008 (3).jpg\nImage:George Bush - March 27, 2008 (4).jpg",

Last week, 2.3 million cars in the US were recalled due to the pedal issues.\n\nThe chief executive of Toyota Motor Europe commented on the recall. \"We understand that the current situation is creating concerns and we deeply regret it,\" said Tadashi Arashima. The firm, however, noted that it wasn't aware of any accidents resulted by the malfunctioning accelerator pedals, and not many pedal problem incidents were reported in Europe. \"The potential accelerator pedal issue only occurs in very rare circumstances,\" Arashima added.\n\nThe National Automobile Dealers Association, meanwhile, commented that Toyota showrooms could lose as much as US$2.47 billion worth of revenue due to the incident.\n\n\"Toyota veterans will likely hear the news with disbelief and keep faith in the brand, but new customers could definitely be scared off,\" remarked Robert Rademacher, who is the president of the trade group ZDK, as quoted by Business Week. \"This recall has a dimension which we've never seen before.\"\n\nThere are concerns that the problem may result in reduced consumer trust in Toyota.\nHans-Peter Wodniok, an analyst for Fairesearch GmbH &amp; Co. in Germany, noted: \"If this is a one-time event, huge as it is, Toyota may be forgiven.

    "original_text": "Japan\nJapan's nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, yesterday said the revealed leaking of an estimated 300 metric tons of radioactive water at the damaged Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant was a \"serious incident\", level three on the seven-part international scale.\n\nTokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), who run the plant, announced the leak last week and the new accident's level-three rating was made after consultation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, the Nuclear Regulation Authority notes this estimate may be overstated as it relies on the leaking tank being full before the leak began.\n\nThere is no gauge to measure water quantities inside the tank, used to store contaminated water after the initial accident. Water is being collected at a rate of 400 tons per day, and an unknown quantity of radioactive groundwater is flowing into the sea.\n\nIndustry minister Toshimitsu Motegi has already announced increased governmental supervision of TEPCO's leak mitigation after two other leaks this year. Motegi said TEPCO's antileak methods were like \"whack-a-mole\". Nuclear Regulation Authority disaster taskforce leader Shinji Kinjo has said TEPCO fails to document inspections and is poor at monitoring the tanks on the site. TEPCO staff had said water levels in the tank had remained constant.\n\nShunichi Tanaka, head of the Nuclear Regulation Authority, said \"We have no idea whether it's actually 300 tons that leaked. We need to look into this issue more.\" TEPCO initially said the leak was small when it was found in July and the watchdog gave it a level one \"anomaly\" rating at the time. Inspectors now say radiation below this tank stands at 100 millisieverts per hour, and another at the facility has a level of 70 millisieverts per hour.\n\n\"One hundred millisieverts per hour is equivalent to the limit for accumulated exposure over five years for nuclear workers; so it can be said that we found a radiation level strong enough to give someone a five-year dose of radiation within one hour,\" said TEPCO boss Masayuki Ono last week. TEPCO shares dropped yesterday by 2.6% to 497 yen.",

    "original_text": "Economy and businessLeaders and central banks in Russia, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Kazakhstan have called for an international currency system.\n\nSpeaking on April 1 in advance of the G-20 summit in London, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev argued that the international finance system needed a \"new construction\" including \"new currency systems\", saying that such a new system could be the purpose of a revamped IMF and World Bank. The IMF was originally founded in 1946 as the overseer of the Bretton Woods system, which from its founding until the 1970s tied the western world's currencies to the US Dollar, which was in turn backed by gold. Russia's proposal was for the new currency to serve as a reserve currency, one which would take the place of the dollar, euro, and other heavily-traded currencies as an international standard of exchange.\n\nMedvedev's comments are a reversal of Russian position from a lukewarm response following a looser outline for a worldwide currency by Kazakhstani president Nursultan Nazarbayev. On March 11, Nazarbayev suggested the establishment of the \"acmetal\", a portmanteau of \"acme\" and \"capital\", as a reserve currency replacing the ruble in international transactions, first for Central Asia and then worldwide. 1999 Economics Nobel laureate Robert Mundell, speaking to the Daily Telegraph, endorsed the idea, saying \"It would be a very good idea if the G-20 took that idea up in London\".\n\n2001 Nobel economics prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, meanwhile, said the new currency could come about quickly if it was based on an expansion of the IMF's already established system of Special Drawing Rights, units of exchange used by the IMF which already have some of the features of currency. Stiglitz argued that, as the US dollar has become the standard global reserve currency, it has inadvertently created a system which hurts the world economy. \"It's a net transfer, in a sense, to the United States of foreign aid,\" he argued, reasoning that when other countries purchase US dollars in order to use them on international markets (such as for the buying and selling of petroleum), they effectively give the US a zero-interest loan &amp;mdash; sometimes at times when they can least afford it. Stiglitz made his comments as head of a United Nations panel of economists giving recommendations to address the global financial crisis.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the G-20 conference, the People's Republic of China also began discussing a new system for reserve currencies. In a March 23 speech, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, endorsed a new reserve currency, saying \"the desirable goal of reforming the international monetary system, therefore, is to create an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations and is able to remain stable in the long run, thus removing the inherent deficiencies caused by using credit-based national currencies.\" Zhou went on to endorse the expansion of the SDR system in the long-term creation of a reserve currency government by the IMF. While Zhou did not mention the US dollar specifically, analysis by Qu Hongbin, chief China economist for HSBC, for the Financial Times said that the speech \"is a clear sign that China, as the largest holder of US dollar financial assets, is concerned about the potential inflationary risk of the US Federal Reserve printing money\".\n\nChina holds $740 billion as assets; inflation in the US economy, which has been low in recent years, would directly cause those assets to lose value.\n\nWhile the Chinese government has engaged in currency swaps with several other growing economies, such as South Korea, Argentina, Malaysia and Indonesia, the Chinese Yuan cannot be used itself as a reserve currency as it cannot be freely traded on the global market.\n\nThe Chinese-Russian proposal was not entered onto the agenda at the G-20 meeting itself. Nonetheless, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that the G-20 was open to considering the proposal if and when a detailed one is presented. United States President Barack Obama, meanwhile, endorsed the continuation of dollar supremacy, saying that the US dollar is \"extraordinarily strong\" and arguing that its strength was the result of the intrinsic stability of the United States economic and political system; US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner had, the week before, made comments that while he supported an expansion in the SDR mechanism he rejected the idea of a global currency. Rather than change the role of SDRs, the G-20 meeting instead added $250 billion in support to the fund backing SDRs.\n\nAfter the G-20 conference ended on Thursday, Malaysia's The Star BizWeek reported that the central banks of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand had endorsed the Chinese proposal. All three countries have close economic ties with China and suffered heavily from the collapse of their currencies in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis; the sudden growth in the value of the US dollar relative to those countries' native currencies sharply increased debt in Southeast Asia's economies, leading to a wave of bankruptcies.\n\nInternational reaction from other economies has been mixed and guarded. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil, said that the currency proposal was important to discuss but did not give extensive comment. And while UPI reports that India supported the SDR proposal at the G-20 conference, the Indian Press Trust quotes Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as saying last month, \"It is too early to talk about common currency.\"\n\nCalls for an independent global reserve currency are not new. In 1944, John Maynard Keynes proposed the \"bancor\", a unit like the SDR supported by a basket of commodities. Keynes' idea was rejected and the US dollar took the equivalent role under the Bretton Woods system. Keynes proposed that the bancor system would be reinforced by a tax on participating countries' current accounts, the difference between their exports and their imports, in order to encourage balanced trade. Meanwhile, monetary unions have become more popular since the end of the gold standard, with most of the European Union now trading the euro, and several countries outside the EU using it as a de facto currency; five West African countries adopting the eco at the end of this year; and the African Union planning to introduce the afro in 2028. Proposals for a North American currency union based around the so-called \"amero\" have been frequently discussed as the focus of conspiracy theories in the United States, but none of the US, Canada or Mexico have actively pursued the establishment of any such monetary union, however the dollar is the currency of several Latin American countries.",

    "original_text": "A highly radioactive lead ball that vanished from a factory in China has been traced to a Shaanxi Province metalworks. The ball was removed during the dismantling of a factory in Tongchuan City.\n\nThe component vanished on Monday when workers broke up the Shaanxi Qinling Cement Company's 53-year-old factory for not meeting environmental standards. The ball contains the radioactive isotope caesium-137 and was part of a scale to gauge the quantity of goods passing on a conveyor belt.\n\nCaesium-137 emits gamma rays which can damage the nervous system, lead to infertility and be fatal. It is formed by nuclear fission.\n\nInvestigators thought the missing part had most likely been accidentally mixed in with scrap and sold on to metalworkers. On Friday, high levels of radiation were detected at the Xingbao Steel and Iron Company Ltd. The Weinan City business had bought eight truckloads of scrap metal from the cement factory.\n\nFurther investigations determined that the ball had been melted down in the No. 6 smelter at Xingbao's factory. Slag from the smelter was found to be radioactive, and technicians are now working to clean the toxic slag and the smelter. Xi'an-based Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology researcher Wang Xuhui stated that the steel products themselves were safe, as the caesium-137 had mostly ended up in the slag.",

    "original_text": "Indonesia\nJusman Syafii Djamal, minister of transport for Indonesia, has recommended that local airlines should not purchase aircraft from European manufacturers, such as Airbus. It is a direct response to the decision of the European Union (EU) to add all 51 of Indonesia's air carriers to the list of air carriers banned in the EU.\n\nThe EU made the decision to ban the Indonesian air traffic due to a string of accidents in the country, including two major disasters this year - the losses of Adam Air Flight 574 and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which killed 102 and 21 people respectively.\n4=Transportation minister Jusman Syafii Djamal\n\"We do not need to buy aircraft from Europe as long as the flying ban stays unrevoked,\" Detik.com quoted Djamal as saying, although Xinhua translated the quote as: \"As long as the ban is still in place, it is better we do not buy aircraft from Europe.\"\n\n\"If aircraft are purchased and registered as Indonesian in Europe, we are worried the planes won't be able to fly to Indonesia because Indonesian airlines' aircraft are banned from flying over Europe,\" he continued. Djamal is concerned that instead new European planes would have to be flown into Indonesia prior to registration, with higher costs incurred as a result.\n\nThe announcement, which had already been issued to airlines two weeks ago, was made at a joint press conference with Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla in Jakarta. Djamal told reporters that he felt the best option was the lifting of the ban. \"The easiest way is to lift the ban, because the ban goes against the principle of open sky policy,\" he said.\n\nIndonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has already postponed a diplomatic visit to Europe, citing the ban as his reason. Normally, the president flies on an aircraft operated by state-owned national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia.\n\nA European Commission review was held in Brussels on November 28. Although bans were lifted on Pakistani flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines and Surinam carrier Blue Wing Airlines, the sanctions on Indonesian airlines remained in force.\n\nMultiple local air carriers are considering the possibility of fleet expansions, with some evaluating Airbus jets as possible options. Airbus, in particular, charge an added cost for taking an aircraft to Indonesia for registration. \"There is an additional cost that must be paid by Indonesian airlines that buy the (Airbus) plane from Europe, US$200,000 ,\" said Djamal. \"Because of that we recommend not buying planes from Europe. As long as the EU ban is still in place, there will be additional payment.\"\n\nHowever, he went on to say that should a manufacturer be willing to pay the cost itself, he did not object to the purchase of the aircraft. He has also confirmed that no Indonesian officers will be sent to Europe to assist with the situation.",

The U.S. Senate passed the treaty in June.\n\nSimilar to the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, CAFTA would create a free trade zone putting an end to most trade barriers between the United States and six additional countries, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe free trade agreement faces stiff opposition among Democrats. Many Republicans who represent agricultural Corn Belt or industrial Rust Belt and southern textile states in Congress also have stated opposition to the bill. But with a Republican majority in the House large enough to ensure passage of CAFTA, party leaders are trying to shore up enough votes to ensure CAFTA's passage.\n\nThis has prompted last minute action by the President to lobby individual members of the House, reminding them that Central American countries have committed troops and other resources to fight the U.S. War on Terror. Other Republican leaders have been using the party's traditional pro-business message and linking it to homeland security issues.\n\n\"Trade creates jobs and lifts people out of poverty and there's nothing like a stable society to fight terrorism and strengthen democracy, freedom and rule of law,\" Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House, reportedly said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nBut the opposition disagrees. CAFTA is \"a bad deal for Central Americans and also for Latinos in this community... (with CAFTA) the exploitation of workers will continue in Central America,\" Democrat Representative Hilda Solis of Los Angeles said. Her views are common among Democrats, who are overwhelmingly against the treaty.\n\nAccording to opponents of CAFTA, the current trend of American jobs being sent to foreign countries, particularly in the information technology sector, would greatly expand under the treaty.\n\n\"This will be a vote in the middle of the night. They'll keep the vote open for several hours, in violation of the rules. If it passes, it will be by fewer than five votes,\" predicted Rep. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, according to a Washington Post report.",

AU trade and industry commissioner Albert Muchanga announced Benin was to join. The commissioner said, \"We haven't yet agreed on rules of origin and tariff concessions, but the framework we have is enough to start trading on July 1, 2020\".\n\nNiger's president Mahamadou Issoufou said, \"Nigeria is Africa's biggest economy and most populous country. Without Nigeria the free trade zone would've been handicapped.\"\n\nThe agreement seeks to remove tariffs on 90 percent of commodities and better intregrate African economies.\n\nAt the opening of the AU summit, AU chairperson President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt said, \"The success of the AfCFTA will be the real test to achieve the economic growth that will turn our people's dream of welfare and quality of life into a reality\".\n\nWith Sunday's signings, all but one of the member states of the 55-member AU have signed on to the agreement, with Eritrea the only state unsigned. African leaders have negotiated the deal over the last four years. While 54 nations have signed onto the AfCFTA, only 27 have ratified the agreement.\n\nWhile many transactions in Africa occur using U.S. dollars or euros, the AU announced an electronic pan-African payment system.\nAfrican Export–Import Bank president Okey Oramah said the use of third-party currencies \"costs Africa between $5 and $7 billion,\" further saying, \"Beyond that, it also reduces trade because Africa has a scarcity of foreign exchange.\"\n\nThere are reportedly 1.3 billion people in the free trade area, with the combined economies of the countries worth US$3.4 trillion. One of the stated goals of AfCFTA is to encourage more intra-Africa trade. Currently about 16–17 percent of African trade occurs between African countries. This is in contrast to the European Union members, where intra-European trade accounts for over 60 percent of trade.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said in May the AfCFTA might be for African countries comparable to the European and North American trade blocs as an \"economic game changer\".\n\nSeven members states had bid to host the AfCFTA secretariat, the operational organ of the free trade agreement, with Ghana winning the bid.",

    "original_text": "The Bundesverfassungsgericht has declared legislation which would have allowed the German Air Force to shoot down hijacked passenger planes unconstitutional.\n\nThe Luftsicherheitsgesetz (literally: Aviation Safety Act) was passed in January 2005 and mainly dealt with uncontroversial matters concerning the safety at airports. One provision however allowed the minister of defense to order the Air Force to shoot down a hijacked plane as a last resort if it could be presumed that that plane would be used as a weapon to kill people on the ground.\n\nThe court based its decision to strike down that provision on three considerations:\n:1) It found that the federal government lacks the legislative competence for that part of the act under the Basic Law, the German constitution, which gives the states the main authority to fight disasters and thus, as the court, implied terrorism. Only the federal cabinet acting as a whole could overrule that in certain cases and as the act specifically gives only one minister, the defense minister, that authority it is unconstitutional.\n\n:2) The court also found that the act is incompatible with the constitutional right to life and the human dignity. The act would turn passengers and crew of a hijacked plane, victims themselves, into \"objects\"--- not only to the terrorists, but also to the state, which does not have the authority to kill innocents. If their deaths would be used to save others they would be reduced to mere \"things\" at the pleasure of the state. Further, the court believes that the arguments of the federal government, saying that passengers in such a situation would die anyway, are invalid, as human lives deserve protection regardless of the expected duration of their existence and that it is impossible to fully assess the situation leading to an eventual invocation of the act.\n\n:3) The third consideration concerned planes manned solely by terrorists. Shooting down those would not violate the right to life and human dignity as in 2), however as described under 1) the federal government lacks competence to pass such legislation.\n\nGerhart Baum, a former interior minister and one of the plaintiffs, hailed the decision as \"historic\" and said that were it not for that ruling \"we would have martial law while fighting crime\".\n\nDefense minister Franz Josef Jung said \"it is our duty to protect the citizens from terrorism\". He announced that he would consider lobbying to change the Basic Law.\n\nThe ruling is expected to also have bearing on current discussions to extend the mandate of the Bundeswehr (German military forces) to help police large events like the upcoming soccer world championship in Germany, as it implicitely reaffirms the separation of armed forces and the police.",

The Conservative-led coalition government announced two weeks ago that the licence fee is to be frozen for six years, and that the BBC will take over responsibility from the Foreign Office for funding the World Service.\nsource=Mitch Benn, 2 Nov 2010\nThe song, loosely inspired by Billy Joel, lists many of the BBC's achievements. Benn, a regular on BBC Radio 4's satirical programme The Now Show, decided to release I'm Proud of the BBC as a single after realising that it was provoking emotional responses from audiences during his nationwide tour. He told BBC Radio 5 Live that the song was receiving standing ovations, and people were wiping away tears. A video was filmed last month outside of Broadcasting House, White City and Television Centre with a cast of volunteers recruited from the social networking site Twitter.\n\nThe song was officially released as a 'download-only' track on Monday. Yesterday's charts reveal that it has reached pole position on Amazon's rock chart, and is listed as the 14th most downloaded track overall. iTunes listed it as the 64th most downloaded song. Fans have created two Facebook groups to promote the single in an attempt to get it to a good position in the UK Singles Chart, which would force the BBC's commercial rivals to play the track.\n\nBenn says that he has always been a supporter of the BBC, and yesterday compared it to the emergency services. \"You also pay for the Fire Brigade, whether or not your house burns down. Public service.\" He points out that he only receives a small percentage of his income from the corporation; last night he played with his band The Distractions at the Bloomsbury Theatre in London.",

G. S.

    "original_text": "New measures to counter the threat of terrorism in UK are expected in the Queen’s Speech.\n\nSir Ian Blair, Metropolitan police chief, in a speech in Berlin, highlighted the scale of disaffection among the Muslim community, pointing to reports that between 40,000 and 120,000 Muslims believed that the London bombings, when four British suicide bombers killed 52 civilians, were justified. He believed that this disaffection was related to the very negative way in which many in the Muslim community perceived the country’s foreign policy. This view had been expressed last month by Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett and by the Head of MI5, Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller, earlier in the week. However, Prime minister Tony Blair contested the strong connection to foreign policy, saying that the problem has \"grown up over a generation\".\n\nSir Ian outlined where he thought new legislation was needed. Despite the fact that the measure had caused the Government to be defeated in the last session of Parliament, he wanted the extension of the 28 days suspects can be held without charge to be reconsidered. He wanted the law restricting the reporting of court proceedings relaxed to let people, particularly in the communities from which those on trial come, to see justice being done. As things stand, once they have charged a suspect, the police have no right to continue questioning; this should be changed, he said. He also wanted phone tap evidence to be allowed in court and flag burning to be made illegal. Home Secretary John Reid will have an opportunity of introducing new legislation in the Queen's Speech.\n\nFollowing Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller’s statement that MI5 has the task of keeping track of 1,600 suspects engaged in 30 known terrorist plots with a staff of 2,800, and that disaffection is increasing as never before, it is expected that more resources will be provided to support her department’s work. Patrick Mercer, the shadow homeland security minister said that both the intelligence and security servcies needed a substantial increase in resources. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has said that his first priority as Prime Minister would be to head anti-terrorism measures personally. In his present post he has responsibility for the allocation of resources to government departments.\n\nThe opinion poll findings quoted by Dame Eliza are questioned by the 1990 Trust (a charitable trust supported by the Rowntree Trust, Comic Relief, CRE and others). Introducing an internet survey conducted between the 8th and 27th September 2006, Karen Chouhan of the 1990 Trust said \"This (referring to Dame Manningham-Buller’s speech) is nothing short of irresponsible politicking and journalism which is designed to create a moral panic to pave the way for renewed legislative assaults on civil liberties and can only serve to fuel fears and hostility towards Muslim communities in the UK\". The specific criticism of the use being made of the ICM/Sunday Telegraph Poll, that has been widely reported, is that \"some sections of the media have conflated Muslim respondents answering positively to the question of whether they have sympathy ‘with the feeling and motives of those who carried out the attacks’ (20% of those polled in the same ICM/Telegraph survey of February 2006 answered affirmatively) with the violence itself. To understand the motive behind an action cannot be equated with violence itself, and the media have a responsibility to create a clear demarcation\".\n\nA Report from the Joseph Rowntree Trust, by Professor Stuart Weir, Director of Democratic Audit at the University of Essex, Dr Andrew Blick and Tufyal Choudhury was published today November 13, 2006. It concludes that \"the government’s counter terrorism legislation and rhetorical stance are between them creating serious losses in human rights and criminal justice protections...and so are prejudicing the ability of the government and security forces to gain the very trust and cooperation from individuals in those communities that they require to combat terrorism.\"\n\nParliament resumes its work next week when the Queen’s Speech will indicate what new anti-terrorist and anti-racist legislation the Government intends to propose.",

In this wave, the third out of four, Israel freed 26 Palestinian prisoners out of 'Ofer' prison in Israel.\n\nThe prisoners, who had been in Israeli prison for 19&amp;ndash;28 years, were released to the West Bank, to the Gaza Strip, and to east Jerusalem where enthusiastic crowds waited for them. The prisoners released to the West Bank in Ramallah were welcomed by the president of the Palestinian National Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, at the presidential residence, and put flowers on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's tomb. Abbas, speaking before thousands of people gathered for the prisoners' release, said, \"We will not sign a final peace deal with Israel before all the prisoners are released\".\n\nIsrael confirmed the release on Saturday, but delayed it until Tuesday for an Israeli court appeal by victims' families to prevent it. The appeal filed by the 'Almagor' organization representing the Israeli victims' families was not accepted. Addressing the issue, the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said at the meeting of his party, \"Leadership is judged by the ability to implement decisions, difficult as they may be. We were not elected to make easy decisions\".\n\nThe United States congratulated Israel on the move and a State Department Deputy Spokeswoman, Marie Harf, told Al Jazeera the Secretary of State, John Kerry, expressed \"his appreciation for Prime Minister Netanyahu's decision to release the third tranche of prisoners ... The Israeli government's commitment to release Palestinian prisoners helped enable the start ... and the continuation of the final status negotiations, and we believe this is a positive step forward in the overall process\".

The Progress Party opposes the idea, saying that people who cannot understand Norwegian could just hum with the Norwegian citizens. Norway celebrated Syttende Mai, its Constitution Day on May 17 with traditional children's parades last week. The song is usually sung on this occasion.\n\nThe editor of Utrop, a newspaper for the minorities in Norway, suggested the translation of the national anthem in an editorial in the national paper Vårt Land. Such a translation, he said, would allow immigrants of Pakistani origin to show their love for Norway by singing the Norwegian national anthem. The title of the national anthem is after all \"Ja vi elsker (dette landet)\" which translates as \"Yes, we love (this country).\"\n\n\"This is integration in reverse,\" said Per-Willy Amundsen, the Progress Party spokesman on issues dealing with immigration. According to him, \"the best gift that the immigrants could give to Norway would be learning the language of their new homeland.\"",

These reports have now been revealed to be a hoax. They were based on a media release and associated website, and reported in Wikinews, as well as a number of print publications in Australia. The president and publisher of Forbes Asia, William Adamopoulos, has confirmed that Mr Bush will not be attending.\n\n\"Mr Bush, Sr. is definitely not attending the conference,\" he said.\n\nMr Adamopoulos said that he is considering pursuing legal action against the originators of the hoax. According to reports, the media release and website used the Forbes name.\n\n\"While we would not wish to oppose free speech in any way - for free speech is one of the things that unites both Australia and the United States - we are investigating what legal action could be open to us,\" he said.\n\nTwo Australian broadsheets fell for the hoax put out by the 30A protest network. The network sent out a press release purporting to be from the organisers of the Annual Forbes Conference, claiming that former US President George H. W. Bush was to attend the conference. Bruce Knobloch of the 30A network indicated that the purpose of the hoax was to show how shallow the media coverage of the conference and the protest is.\n\nThe hoax was originally reported by AAP, who checked the claim with a telephone number provided on the press release before publishing it. The hoax was then picked up by several internet news sites, including this one. AAP quickly published a retraction, however that didn't stop the hoax making its way into the paper versions of two of Australia's most respected broadsheets, The Sydney Morning Herald, and The Australian.\n\nThe Forbes conference will take place at the Sydney Opera House, and will be attended by hundreds of CEOs from around the world, as well as Australian Prime Minister John Howard, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and Steve Forbes himself.\n\nThere is a protest planned to coincide with the conference. Protest organisers have called for people to assemble at Customs Square at Circular Quay at 5pm on Tuesday 30 August. The protest was originally planned for the Opera House forecourt, however police have declared this area to be an exclusion zone.",

At the rally, Edwards addressed Obama's supporters.\n\n\"The Democratic voters in America have made their choice and so have I,\" he told a crowd of cheering supporters.\n\n\"There is one man who knows and understands that this is a time for bold leadership...there is one man who knows in his heart that it is time to create one America, not two - and that man is Barack Obama.\"\n\nThe endorsement comes the day after Clinton defeated Obama by more than 2-to-1 in West Virginia's primary. Edwards received 7% of the vote despite having suspended his campaign in January.\n\nBoth Obama and Clinton immediately asked Edwards for his endorsement, but he stayed mum for more than four months. A person close to Edwards, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he wanted to get involved now to begin unifying the party. Obama also signed on to Edwards' poverty initiative, which was a major cause for Edwards in his campaign and since he left. When Edwards suspended his campaign, he asked both Obama and Clinton to make poverty a central issue in the general election and a future Democratic administration, something both agreed to do.\n\n4=John Edwards\nWhen he made his decision, Edwards didn't even tell many of his former top advisers because he wanted to make sure that he personally talked to Clinton to give her the news, said a person close to him. Edwards' wife, Elizabeth, who has spoken favorably about Clinton's health care plan, did not travel with him to Michigan and is not part of the endorsement.\n\nClinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe said Wednesday that \"We respect John Edwards, but as the voters of West Virginia showed last night, this thing is far from over.\"\n\nAccording to latest estimates, Barack Obama has a total of 1,887 delegates in CNN's count and 1,884 in the Associated Press's count. Both tallies have Clinton trailing Obama with 1,718 delegates. Obama needs just 139 delegates to reach the 2,026 necessary to clinch the party's nomination.\n\nEdwards, meanwhile, has 19 total pledged delegates who may or may not pledge their support for Obama at the Democratic National Committee's August convention in Denver, Colorado.\n\n4=Terry McAuliffe, Clinton campaign chairman\nEdwards, who is not a superdelegate, said last week that it was \"fine\" for Clinton to continue making her case, but expressed concern that a continued campaign could damage the party's prospects in November.\n\nWednesday's endorsement could help Obama reach out to white blue-collar voters, a demographic that Obama has failed to capture, most notably in the recent Pennsylvania and West Virginia primaries. Some political pundits predicted that Edwards' supporters are more likely to lean in Obama's direction.\n\n\"The conventional wisdom is that Barack Obama will pick up maybe 60 percent of them, and in some places, that makes a huge difference,\" former presidential adviser David Gergen said in January.",

It is also the first storm to be named with a letter of the Greek alphabet. Wilma exhausted the English alphabetic list as the 21st named storm; the letters Q, U, X, Y and Z are skipped when naming Atlantic storms.\n\nCurrently, the storm has sustained winds of 40mph, which is only 1mph over the threshold for a tropical storm. It is centered about 70 miles south of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. A tropical storm warning has been issued for Haiti and portions of the Dominican Republic.\n\nAccording to scientists, since 1995 an increase in hurricane activity has been due to a rise in ocean temperatures and decrease of wind shear that rip apart hurricanes.\n\nThe prior record has stood since the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season. However the season does not end till November 30, leaving room for more storms to form and shatter the record. Scientists have noted that the number of very strong hurricanes is likely to increase further in future years as the effects of global warming increase. Researcher Dr Peter Webster stated that \"What I think we can say is that the increase in (hurricane) intensity is probably accounted for by the increase in sea-surface temperature, and I think probably the sea-surface temperature increase is a manifestation of global warming.\"",

    "original_text": "2012 US Presidential Election\nThe following is the fifth in a monthly series chronicling the U.S. 2012 presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after a brief mention of some of the month's biggest stories.\n\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail, a politician from outside the fifty states receives significant mention as a potential Republican Party vice presidential nominee, Wikinews gets the reaction of three Democratic Party candidates after the party strips delegates from two of their fellow challengers, and a minor third party removes its presidential nominee for fraud.\n\nMarch 2012 opened with the unexpected death of citizen journalist Andrew Breitbart at the age of 43. Before he died, Breitbart had claimed to possess a video of President Barack Obama that would change the course of the election. The video, which was released shortly after Breitbart's death, showed Obama as a law student at Harvard University speaking in favor of Derrick Bell, a controversial professor who had accused the American system of being racist. The video disappointed commentators such as Juan Williams, who expected a \"smoking gun\" from Breitbart.\n\nFormer Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney cemented his status as the Republican Party frontrunner with victories in Washington, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Wyoming, the US Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Illinois, and six of the ten Super Tuesday states including Alaska, Idaho, Massachusetts, Ohio, Vermont, and Virginia. He also won the endorsements of former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, and Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Despite the successes, the specter of a brokered convention remained as Romney failed to win enough delegates to secure the nomination.\n\nRomney's closest rival, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, won Kansas, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and three of the Super Tuesday states including North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. However, he suffered some missteps that cost his campaign: he called for English to be adopted as the official language in Puerto Rico as a condition of statehood, and later remarked that if Romney won the nomination and moved to the political center, \"we might as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk of what may be the Etch A Sketch candidate for the future.\" Santorum was alluding to comments from a Romney adviser that compared the campaign to an Etch A Sketch in that \"we shake it up and we start all over again\" for the general election. However, Santorum's comments were interpreted as a suggestion that voters should favor the Democrat Obama over Romney, which Santorum later denied.\n\nMeanwhile, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Congressman Ron Paul continued their campaigns for the GOP nomination. Paul finished second in Washington, North Dakota, Vermont, and Virginia, and won the popular vote, but not the majority of delegates, in the Virgin Islands. Gingrich focused his energies on the southern states. He won his home state of Georgia on Super Tuesday, and came in second place in Alabama and Mississippi. Most notably during March, Gingrich proclaimed he could reduce gas prices in the United States to $2.50 a gallon through increased oil drilling. President Obama used this statement to attack the GOP, arguing that they were playing political games. On energy, Obama called for further development of alternative fuels. Polls showed that high energy prices were negatively affecting his popularity.\n\nAdditionally, the Obama campaign attacked the GOP for the February comments of radio personality Rush Limbaugh that referred to Georgetown University student Sandra Fluke as a \"slut\" and \"prostitute\" after she testified about contraceptive coverage before a congressional hearing. The campaign alleged that the GOP was waging a \"war on women\" for its opposition to the mandate that contraceptives be included on the insurance plans of organizations regardless of their religious views.\n\nForeign affairs and missile defense also became an election topic after an open-microphone during a forum in South Korea captured President Obama tell Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, \"On all these issues, but particularly missile defense... This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility.\" Medvedev replied that he would \"transmit this information to Vladimir Putin\". Romney criticized the comments, arguing \"I think it’s very alarming for the President of the United States to suggest to Russia that he has a different agenda that he’s going to work out with the Russians after the elections\". He then labeled Russia as \"without question, our number one geopolitical foe.\" In response, Medvedev referenced the Cold War and advised the Romney campaign \"to check their watches from time to time: it is 2012, not the mid-1970s.\"\n\nAs Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney campaigned in Puerto Rico ahead of that territory's March 18 Republican presidential primary, at his side was Puerto Rican governor Luis Fortuño. Fortuño had endorsed Romney for president, and has received mention as a potential vice presidential nominee. Commentators argue his presence on a ticket could draw Hispanic support to the GOP.\n\nFortuño was elected in 2008 as the first Republican governor in the territory since 1969. As governor, he sought government cuts and low corporate and individual tax rates in an attempt to improve economic conditions. Newsmax referred to his governorship as the \"Puerto Rico Miracle\" and labeled Fortuño a \"Reaganite\" whose \"example should be followed in the United States\". Political analyst Larry Sabato proclaimed Fortuño \"a godsend to the GOP\".\n\nSignificant talk about Fortuño and the vice presidency started last year. A Wall Street Journal editorial labeled Fortuño a \"fine choice for Vice President\" and GOP operative Roger Stone also endorsed the idea, saying the selection of Fortuño would \"bring charisma, star power and excitement to the campaign.\"\n\nSuch speculation heightened as the 2012 presidential race shifted to Puerto Rico in March. Fortuño campaigned with Romney, leading both CNN and Real Clear Politics to label him as a potential running mate. Fortuño did not comment much on the speculation, but preferred to discuss Romney, saying he believed that as president, Romney would push for Puerto Rican statehood. With Fortuño's assistance, Romney was able to win the Puerto Rican contest with 83 percent of the vote. In his victory speech, Romney commented, \"I intend to become our nominee and I intend to get Latino voters to vote for a Republican.\" According to Fortuño himself, one way to accomplish this would be to select an Hispanic as a running mate.\n\nPolitical consultant Dan Judy of North Star Opinion Research agrees. He tells Wikinews, \"I don't think there's any one silver bullet that will bring a majority Hispanic voters to the Republican side, but I think the selection of Governor Fortuno would help, particularly among Puerto Rican voters living on the mainland.\" According to a Fox News poll from March, Romney receives only 14 percent of the Hispanic vote in a matchup with President Obama, and Judy says that Puerto Ricans vote Democratic at an even higher rate than other Hispanic nationalities. He explains, \"a Puerto Rican on the ticket would at least cause them to take a closer look at the GOP candidate.\"\n\nHowever, Judy warns that Fortuño's eligibility may be questioned since Puerto Rico is not a state. Because of this, he says more attention is given to other Hispanic GOP politicians such as Nevada governor Brian Sandoval, New Mexico governor Susana Martinez and Senator Marco Rubio. Nevertheless, Sandoval is pro-choice on abortion, Martinez may conjure memories of 2008 VP nominee Sarah Palin, and Rubio is Cuban American, a group that largely already supports the GOP.\n\nConstitutional scholar Dr. Ronald Rotunda of Chapman University tells Wikinews that eligibility might not be a concern after all. \"In 1917, Congress provided, by statute that people born in Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States\" says Rotunda, \"while we have no case directly on point, it is probable that a person born in Puerto Rico is eligible to become President or Vice President.\"\n\nAnti-abortion activist Randall Terry qualified for delegates in Oklahoma after winning 18 percent of the vote in the state's Democratic primary against President Obama on Super Tuesday. However, the Democratic Party has decided to remove the delegates from Terry because of his failure to file a delegate slate and for not being a bona fide Democratic presidential candidate. Former U.S. Senate nominee Jim Rogers, who also qualified for delegates in the primary after winning over 15 percent in some congressional districts, was similarly stripped for failing to file.\n\nIn a letter to Terry, the Oklahoma Democratic Party detailed its decision, describing a bona fide presidential candidate as a \"Democrat whose record of public service, accomplishment, public writings and/or public statements affirmatively demonstrates that he or she is faithful to the interests, welfare, and success of the Democratic Party of the United States and will participate in the Convention in good faith.\" It concludes that Terry did not fit this description because he was recently a member of the Republican Party.\n\nAt the March 24 Louisiana Primary, attorney John Wolfe, Jr. qualified for delegates after receiving over 15 percent in some congressional districts of the state. It is not known at this time whether these delegates will be seated at the Democratic National Convention in August, or if he will be subject to the same decision as Terry and Rogers.\n\nWikinews contacted Wolfe and fellow Democratic Party candidates Bob Ely and Darcy Richardson to ask whether they were concerned the Democratic Party leadership would strip delegates from them if they qualified, and award them to President Obama. All three candidates appeared on the Louisiana primary ballot and will appear with Obama on the Texas ballot in May. Only Ely and Richardson appeared with Obama, Terry, and Rogers on the Oklahoma ballot.\n\n*John Wolfe, Jr.: \"The rules are the rules, and like it or not, the delegates are mine. I am an attorney well schooled in many Constitutional Law issues and will make sure that the right thing is done. But, I expect that they will do the right thing and let me have the delegates I have earned. I understand that the good folks at the top of the Louisiana party were surprised at the insurgency ( what with a number of Cajuns howlin' for the Bayou Wolf), but even when there is an overwhelming incumbent in the Presidency, the duty of party officials is to remain neutral and enforce the wishes that the Democratic Primary voters have expressed through the ballot box. Anything else would be a travesty of justice, especially considering the incumbent's huge advantage in every respect.\"\n\n*Bob Ely: \"The system is stacked against interlopers. For example, the only thing on which there is complete agreement amongst both parties is that there is no need for a serious third party. So, concerned? Yes. Surprised? Not at all. Indeed, I would be surprised if Randall Terry were surprised.\"\n\n*Darcy Richardson: \"I'm not too worried about it. In the unlikely event that I win any delegates in the remaining Democratic primaries, my campaign — unlike those of single-issue interloper Randall Terry and the grossly incompetent Jim Rogers of Oklahoma — would file the necessary qualifying paperwork for my delegates within the time prescribed by party rules or statute. There's no reason either of them shouldn't have submitted the appropriate district delegate paperwork by Oklahoma's March 15th deadline. I have no reason to believe that I wouldn't be treated fairly by the Democratic Party. Moreover, I wholeheartedly agree with the DNC's contention that Randall Terry, a lifelong Republican, isn't a \"bona-fide\" candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. He's an embryo-obsessing publicity seeker and showboat who has publicly stated on more than one occasion that he intends to run as an independent candidate in several battleground states this autumn with the sole purpose of trying to siphon enough traditionally Democratic Catholic votes from President Obama to throw those states to whichever one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse happens to win the Republican nomination. From Mitt Romney, a pump-and-dump takeover financier to Ron Paul's failed Austrian economics and his call for a trillion dollars in spending cuts in the first year of his administration, it's a scary lot...each determined to impose draconian austerity measures on the 99% while securing even greater tax cuts for those at the top.\"\n\nFile:Randall Terry 2.jpg|Randall TerryMarc Nozell\nFile:ImageNA.svg|Jim Rogers(image missing)\nFile:John Wolfe, Jr.jpg|John Wolfe, Jr.Marc Nozell\nFile:Bob Ely.jpg|Bob ElyBob Ely\nFile:LG PICs 2 002.JPG|Darcy RichardsonDarcy Richardson\n\nThe membership of the Boston Tea Party (BTP) removed Tiffany Briscoe as the party's presidential nominee after it was discovered that she misrepresented herself as a graduate and member of the Board of Trustees of Howard Community College. Briscoe is actually just a student at the school.\n\nFollowing her nomination, Briscoe spoke with Wikinews and said she would \"probably be able to appear on the ballots of 14 to 15 states throughout the country\". After the removal, she has not responded to inquiries about the future of her campaign. Wikinews was able to contact parliamentary activist and Libertarian Party (LP) presidential candidate James Ogle, who is listed as Briscoe's running mate on her website. As reported last month, Ogle won a majority of the votes over uncommitted at the Missouri Libertarian presidential primary. He says he is in the process of securing a spot for himself and Briscoe as a write-in ticket on the Texas general election ballot. Ogle also plans to be the running mate for five other women candidates including comedienne Roseanne Barr of the Green Party.\n\nAs for the BTP, a new nominee is expected to be announced shortly. Chairman Darryl Perry says the party may be approaching \"the brink of death\" but he remains optimistic. Though he makes no firm predictions about ballot access, Perry expects \"voters in more than a dozen States\" to be able to vote for the BTP nominee, including through write-in eligibility. He argues that the BTP can move beyond the setback and become a major third party if members increase their activity and \"the LP allows itself to be taken over by those who would redefine 'libertarian'.\"\n\nThe BTP was founded in 2006 as an alternative to the LP. According to its platform, it \"supports reducing the size, scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues, and opposes increasing the size, scope and power of government at any level, for any purpose.\" In 2008, the party nominated boxing manager Charles Jay, who appeared on three state ballots and won a total of 2,422 votes.",

Michigan, Oregon, New Mexico, New York, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Idaho, Connecticut, Kentucky and Utah all report human cases of the illness linked to the contaminated spinach. All individuals sickened by the outbreak have the same strain, E. coli O157:H7. Officials are currently investigating cases in Washington, Pennsylvania and California to determine if the new cases are linked to the current outbreak.\n\n\"Based on the current information, FDA advises that consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach at this time. Individuals who believe they may have experienced symptoms of illness after consuming bagged spinach are urged to contact their health care provider,\" said a statement on the Food and Drug Administration's website.\n\nHealth officials report that the symptoms from eating any contaminated spinach are kidney failure or Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome HUS which can occur easily in children and elderly people, bloody diarrhea, mild fever and in some cases death. At least 14 of the infected have suffered kidney failure.\n\n\"Given the severity of this illness and the seriousness of the outbreak, FDA believes that a warning to consumers is needed. We are working closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and state and local agencies to determine the cause and scope of the problem,\" added the statement.\n\nConsumers are urged to throw out any fresh spinach they may have as washing it does not help, but officials say that cooking the spinach could kill the bacteria though officials still urge consumers to throw out all spinach.\n\n\"We are telling everyone to get rid of fresh bagged spinach right now. Don't assume anything is over,\" said Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle. Wisconsin has seen the worst of the outbreak with one death reported and over 30 people infected.\n\n\"If you wash it, it is not going to get rid of it,\" said the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition director, Robert Brackett.\n\nHealth officials also say that they do not know what caused the contamination and do not know where the spinach originated from. Officials believe that the contamination was not \"deliberate.\"\n\n\"It is too early to say where the spinach has come from. This is an active investigation and we will provide more information as it becomes available. We have no evidence that this was deliberate,\" said a spokeswoman for the FDA, Laura Alvey.\n\n A company which produces natural foods in California is suspected to be the source of the illness. Natural Selection Foods LLC. located in San Juan Bautista, California has recalled all of their spinach voluntarily, including any food items containing the vegetable. Some of those infected with the illness have reported eating spinach which came from the company, but officials say that the outbreak may not be entirely isolated to just Natural Selection and that the investigation into the origin of the outbreak is still ongoing.\n\n\"We have temporarily stopped shipping spinach products, and have taken spinach out of our salads that contain them. Everyone at Earthbound Farm is terribly upset about these illnesses and death and their potential relationship to a product that is ordinarily a very healthy food choice. We are committed to producing exceptionally fresh and healthy produce. Quality and food safety continue to be our top priorities,\" said Natural Selections in a statement on its website. Natural Selections is operated by Earthbound Farm.\n\n\"It is possible that the recall and the information will extend beyond Natural Selection Foods and involve other brands and other companies, at other dates,\" said chief medical officer with the FDA's Center for Food Safety, Doctor David Acheson.\n\nNatural Selection sells many different brand names of spinach including Dole, Trader Joe's, Green Harvest, Ready Pac, Earthbound Farm, Rave Spinach and their own brand of spinach, Natural Selections.\n\nOfficials say that more cases are expected to be reported, but many individuals will recover from the illness within a week.\n\nE. coli, on average, affects more than 75,000 people a year and can kill as many as 60.",

By Allah, they will climb your walls and will come to you from where you do not expect.\"\n\n\"Our heroes have woven their grave-clothes with your blood,\" he went on. Nayef, who is also responsible for security affairs, was lightly injured in an August 27 attack that could have claimed his life. The bomber was a militant by the name of Abdullah bin Hassan bin Taleh Assiri, who came to meet him from Yemen to his personal residence. He claimed to wish to hand himself in and also assist a group of other Saudis in Yemen to return home. While making a phone call to one of them in the reception room where they were meeting, he blew himself up.\n\nIn the last few years, Saudi Arabia has been much a target of unrest prevalent in the Middle East.

According to police spokesperson Hugh Carew, D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services responded and found chemicals used to make drugs, but no actual drugs. At first, law enforcement authorities thought they had discovered a methamphetamine lab, but they later found that the drug being produced was the hallucinogen Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT.\n\nAccording to Pete Piringer, a fire department official, seven people were exposed to the chemicals and treated on scene; however, none of them were injured. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has said that the chemicals used to make the drugs were not a health risk to other students.",

In each direction, a line of State Highway Patrol cars was followed by a formation of Department of Transportation construction trucks. A cluster of awaiting vehicles went honking across for a few minutes, then traffic returned to the sparse levels more typical of the pre-dawn period.\n\nThe September 18 opening was well ahead of the scheduled December 24 goal, earning the contractor, Flatiron-Manson, up to $19.6 million in performance bonuses.\n\nThe bridge is 189 feet wide, with a main span length of 504 feet and a deck height of over 100 feet above the Mississippi River. Traffic is expected to return to previous levels of 141,000 vehicles per day on the 10 lanes. The accelerated construction (of only 11 months) was accomplished by pouring 120 concrete sections in heated pole barns, and then lifting them all into place via a crane mounted on a river barge. The bridge contains 323 electronic sensors for real-time monitoring of stresses and movement of the bridge components. It is illuminated with white light-emitting diodes.",

However, the Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) warned of the potential danger the painted the road could pose for drivers and demanded the road be painted over. Despite an online petition gathered almost 15,000 signatures to save the rainbow, the Roads Minister Duncan Gay and Premier Barry O'Farrell decided not to meet the requests from the City of Sydney for the road to remain with the colors of rainbow.\n\nA spokeswoman for Gay's office cited road safety hazard and unsafe behavior as the reason for removal, including people who sat in the road to take pictures. Alex Greenwich, the local representative from Sydney in the New South Wales state government, had organised the petition earlier and said Gay exaggerated the potential safety hazards, and said that people took pictures during the parade of Mardi Gras, when there was no traffic.\n\nSydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore also disputed Mr Gay's claims, citing no safety hazards, \"The audit also shows that generally the risk to the public of having the rainbow crossing is low. This is bureaucracy gone wild — the Minister wants to remove the crossing because he doesn't like some pictures that people have been taking. Those pictures are a drop in the ocean compared to the tens of thousands of other pictures of the crossing that have ... promoted Oxford St as one of the best LGBT tourism destinations in the world.\" The walk is scheduled to be painted over this week and will cost about AU$35,000.",

My intent is to continue to rally the world, to send a focused signal to the Iranian government that we will continue to work to isolate you in the hopes that at some point somebody else shows up and says it’s not worth the isolation,\" said Bush during a press conference.\n\nThe Tehran Times responded to Bush reporting that \"either Bush has gone totally mad and now makes statements without consulting his advisors, or the neo-conservatives are dreaming of a new world order and no longer feel compelled to hide their goal and U.S. officials should put a muzzle on Bush to prevent him from giving people the impression that the United States is the main threat to world peace.\"\n\nPutin in a telephone question and answer session advises that Russia is developing a \"big, grandiose\" plan to boost the country's defenses with new types of nuclear weapons to defeat the U.S. anti-missile system based in Europe.\n\n\"Our plans are not simply considerable, but huge. At the same time they are absolutely realistic. I have no doubts we will accomplish them. I can assure you that such steps are being prepared and we will take them,\" stated Putin.\n\nAnalysts said Mr Putin's latest remarks were designed to reassure his public that Russia still had an effective nuclear deterrent. But they were also a message to Washington: that its new and costly missile shield was effectively useless against the latest Russian technology.\n\nPutin even suggested that the U.S. might be after Siberia’s resources and the U.S. has considered invading Russia. One thing Putin was certain of is that there are quite a few politicians in the United States who engage in what he described as \"political erotica,\" something that \"may or may not give pleasure to people, but is unlikely to generate any results,\" Putin added.",

Ford alleged he had heard another prisoner claim ownership of the marijuana found in Corby’s possession. He told the Balinese court that Corby was the victim of an Australian domestic inter-airport drug-smuggling operation. She is currently serving a 20-year prison term after being convicted in that case.\n\nIn December 2005, a County Court jury convicted Ford of 11 charges, including rape, intentionally causing injury, threatening to inflict serious injury, false imprisonment, aggravated burglary, burglary, making threats to kill and stalking, but a suppression order issued by the court prevented publication of the convictions until the pre-sentencing hearing on Friday, January 27, 2006.\n\nFord’s lawyer, Tom Danos, told the hearing that Corby had written to Ford thanking him for risking his own welfare by agreeing to testify. Danos urged the court to be lenient in sentencing Ford, claiming that his victim had effectively forgiven him for his crimes and that he deserved a lighter sentence for co-operating with authorities investigating the Corby case.\n\nFord has been attacked twice in jail since testifying at Corby’s Bali trial. Since returning from Bali in March, 2005, Ford has remained in protective custody, to prevent further attacks. Danos claimed that this would make any jail sentence particularly difficult for his client.\n\nCounty Court Judge Margaret Rizkalla adjourned the pre-sentencing hearing to a date yet to be set.",

    "original_text": "Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General for England and Wales, has vetoed a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to release correspondence sent by Prince Charles to government ministers while Tony Blair was Prime Minister from September 2004 to April 2005.\n\nThe decision by the Attorney General overturns a previous decision by the Administrative Appeals Chamber which said there was a public interest in publishing the letters.\n\nIn a statement, Grieve made a case for it being in the public interest to not release the documents. He noted that the publication of the Prince's correspondence would damage his preparation for kingship by damaging the public perception that he is \"party-political neutral\" by showing the Prince disagreeing with the policies of the government. Grieve then stated \"any such perception would be seriously damaging to his role as future Monarch, because if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the Throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is King\".\n\nGrieve's statement did note that the letters from Prince Charles \"reflect his personal and deeply held views and convictions\" and \"are in many cases particularly frank\" but notes there is \"nothing improper in the nature or content of these letters\".\n\n4=Graham Smith\nThe Freedom of Information Act request was made by Rob Evans, a journalist writing for The Guardian. The Guardian stated they intend to take the government to court to challenge Grieve's decision.\n\nGraham Smith from the anti-monarchist group Republic said, \"the decision is a serious affront to British democracy\". Smith argued: \"Grieve has said this is about protecting prince Charles’s impartiality, but that impartiality doesn’t exist. Charles has made that clear. This decision is about pretending Charles is impartial while he continues to lobby in favour of his own political agenda. If Grieve believes Charles to be impartial then let him prove it by allowing the release of these documents.\"\n\nPrince Charles has been criticised in the past for repeated use of his power and influence. The architect Richard Rogers claimed that the Prince, who has strongly traditionalist views on architecture, repeatedly intervened to have projects cancelled which he was working on. Rogers criticised the decision not to release Charles' correspondence: \"It is not democratic to cover up his interventions.\"",

However, the Internet censorship is not just on Baidupedia because it's due to the keyword filtering technology on the Great Firewall of China.\n\nOne of the first people to find this filtering technology was Shi-Min Fang, a biochemist with a stance against ethical lapses in China. Fang, whose site \"新語絲\" has been blocked by the PRC government for years, had found that his Chinese name cannot be searched since last August if someone outside China uses an Internet search engine that is based in China. He posted a message to his own forum. A forum visitor gave him a method to verify what he found. By randomly choosing a website URL that is in China and adding banned keywords to that URL, the server connection will be reset without displaying the normal \"page does not exist\" error message. Take http://www.163.com/六四 for example, if you use that URL to link to the site when you are outside China, you will find the server connection will be reset.\n\nA Chinese Wikinews reporter, Shi Zhao, also performed this test. He chose some political keywords such as \"民主\" (Democracy), \"江泽民\" (Jiang Zemin), \"法轮功\" (Falun Gong) and asked people to search on Google, Baidu and Sogou (a Chinese search engine developed by Sohu), and some Wikipedians from China, Taiwan and United States joined the test.\n\nFrom the test, Chinese tester Shi Zhao found there is no problem to search such political keywords on Chinese search engines other than Google. And Taiwanese testers H.T. Chien, Alex S.H. Lin and American tester roc found they will get the \"server connection has been reset\" error message when they tried to search those political keywords on Chinese search engines other than Google.\n\nFrom the test the testers believe that the keyword filtering technology on the Great Firewall of China is bi-directional. People outside China cannot visit any Chinese websites that have political keywords, and people in China cannot visit any websites outside China that has political keywords.\n\nBaidupeida that went online this April is a service that provided by the Chinese Internet search company, Baidu, and its form is very similar to Wikipedia, which is blocked by the PRC government since last year. It would also allow users to join the editing on Baidupedia.",

Professor Reiss, who was director of education at the Royal Society, said that since a substantial number of pupils have concerns about the issue, they are likely to \"detach from\" science if their concerns and world view are not addressed. Creation should not be taught, he said, but if it comes up, teachers should be encouraged to explain the science of evolution. He also said that students should be taught the nature of a scientific theory - that it does not simply mean a hypothesis about the way things might work, but a rigorously supported system of ideas that fit with the available evidence.\n\nThe Times of London reported him as saying that Creationism should be taught in science classes as a legitimate point of view. This provoked a storm of protest from a group that included two Nobel Laureates and other scientists who strongly oppose the teaching, or even the discussion of creation in science class.\n\nYesterday the Royal Society said in a statement that some of Professor Reiss' comments had been \"open to misinterpretation\", and that this had damaged the Society's reputation. \"As a result, Professor Reiss and the Royal Society have agreed that, in the best interests of the society, he will step down immediately as director of education.\" The Royal Society went on to say: \"However, if a young person raises creationism in a science class, teachers should be in a position to explain why evolution is a sound scientific theory and why creationism is not, in any way, scientific.\"\n\nThe chief executive of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Roland Jackson, said that the Royal Society should have supported Professor Reiss and used this opportunity to further a reasoned debate. \"I was at the actual discussion, and what I heard him say, however it has been reported, was essentially the position advocated by the Royal Society,\" Jackson said.\n\n2008-09-18",

    "original_text": "Economy and business\n\nUnited Kingdom-based pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) confirmed January 15 it had rejected three \"unsolicited, conditional and non-binding proposals\" by Unilever to acquire its Consumer Healthcare division, including one bid of GBP50 billion in value made on December 20, believing Unilever \"fundamentally undervalued\" the business and its potential.\n\nNews that Unilever attempted to buy GSK Consumer Healthcare for 50 billion pounds, split between GBP41.7 billion in cash and 8.3 billion in Unilever shares, was first reported by The Sunday Times, and subsequently confirmed by both companies. Had the latest acquisition offer gone through, it would have been the largest deal since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and one of the biggest ever among companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nA deal would likely mean integrating the GSK division into Unilever's own beauty and personal care business, which has seen profit margins struggle under Covid-19 lockdowns and higher costs for plastics and petrochemicals.\n\nA brief response on the Unilever website confirmed it \"had approached GSK and Pfizer about a potential acquisition\", and adds GSK Consumer Healthcare \"would be a strong strategic fit\" as the company looks to rework its portfolio. GSK indicated the proposals were \"carefully evaluated\" by its board of directors, but unanimously rejected under the conclusion they \"were not in the best interests of GSK shareholders\" and \"failed to reflect the intrinsic value of the business and its potential\".\n\nThe Sunday Times have indicated the latest deal did not include an acquisition premium or recognition of corporate synergies; the joint venture between GSK and healthcare firm Pfizer, which holds a minority stake in the company, was initially projected to generate GBP500 million in cost savings by this year and realise \"substantial cost synergies\". The BBC's business editor Simon Jack wrote that a standard takeover premium would be about 30%, but could be reduced over the GBP10 billion in debt GSK was predicted to \"leave on the books\", of the GBP22 billion net debt GSK reported for Q3 2021.\n\nThe deals were assessed by the Board respective of a proposed demerger of GSK Consumer Health into a separate PLC in the middle of this year. Jack wrote GSK \"always\" had \"an open mind to a trade sale to another party if the price was right.\" Unilever did not take into account the standard takeover premium, the value of cost savings and Board confidence Consumer Health could deliver \"superior organic sales growth\" of between four and six per cent in the medium term. This was despite valuations of about GBP50 billion by Goldman Sachs and Barclays analysts, and a lower GBP45 billion valuation by Jeffries Group.\n\nThere are no current talks between Unilever and either Pfizer or GSK, and the Unilever statement reads: \"There can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached.\" Under CEO Alan Jope, Unilever has focused its investments and marketing on brands which \"communicate a strong environmental or social purpose\" by streamlining its holdings in items like beauty products and tea. Jope previously said Unilever would concentrate on smaller takeovers in industries like luxury beauty and wellness.\n\nHowever, Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, told the BBC this would be a \"high risk deal\" at a time investors are cautious about GSK's performance, but also a time of rising inflation he says encourages \"consumer goods with loyal customers\". Mould added despite strong cashflow, Unilever had recently missed targets on sales and profit margins, putting pressure on the CEO.\n\nPressure by activist shareholders Elliott Management Corporation and Bluebell Capital Partners have also mounted against GSK CEO Emma Walmsley over the unit's failure to develop a Covid-19 vaccine and Walmsley's own lack of scientific experience. GSK has been involved in the ongoing development of a Covid-19 vaccine with French biopharmaceutical company Sanofi, and announced preliminary results from Phase 3 trials last month.\n\nIn 2018, Unilever bought several consumer nutritional products from GSK, including its flagship product Horlicks, and merged its Indian subsidiary, Hindustan Unilever, with GSK Consumer Healthcare India.",

The issue features Peter Parker visiting Washington, D.C., on photo assignment to cover the Presidential and Vice Presidential inauguration ceremony. The Chameleon is also in town, hoping to sabotage the ceremony with a look-a-like impostor of Obama. Parker's alter-ego Spiderman must save the day from his arch-enemy's nefarious plans.\n\nThe issue will appear on newsstands January 14, before the actual inauguration.\n\nAmong the lines of dialog in the issue are \"Ya hear that, Chameleon? The president-elect here just appointed me ... secretary of shuttin' you up.\"\n\nThe issue will have a commemorative cover, and retail for US$3.99 (£2.65). Alan Giroux, owner of All About Books and Comics in Phoenix, says he predicts the issue to be on the collectors' market for $20 by the first day. \"This issue will have a lot of heat and go for premium prices. I already have people calling about it,\" he said.\n\nThe issue's cover will feature Obama smiling, with a thumbs up pose. Spiderman is featured hanging upside-down beside him, whispering: \"Hey, if you get to be on my cover, can I be on the dollar bill?\"\n\nThe issue is not official merchandise of the US Democratic Party, Obama campaign, the Obama-Biden Transition Project, or White House.\n\nAccording to Marvel comic's editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, the publication series learned that the President-elect is a long-time fan and collector as a kid of the Marvel super hero. \"When we heard that president-elect Obama is a collector of Spider-Man comics, we knew that these two historic figures had to meet in our comics' Marvel Universe. A Spider-Man fan moving into the Oval Office is an event that must be commemorated in the pages of Amazing Spider-Man.\"\n\nDuring his campaigning, Mr. Obama made mention of Spider-Man at child-oriented events. He told Entertainment Weekly magazine that Batman and Spider-Man were his favorite superheroes, because of their \"inner turmoil\".\n\nQuesada remarked that \"there is a long history of presidents appearing in Spider-Man comics, from Franklin D. Roosevelt through to George W. Bush, who has appeared on several occasions.\"\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan appeared in the pages of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Bill Clinton appeared in Superman: The Man of Steel and Richard Nixon in Watchmen.",

Due to his medical background, it is believed his mission was to find and meet Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's second-in-command. The CIA declined to comment on the reports.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, al-Balawi posted online in jihadist forums under the name Abu Dujanah al-Khurasani. One post by him read, \"When a fighter for God kills a U.S. soldier on the corner of a tank, the supporters of Jihad have killed tens of thousands of Americans through their connection to the opposition.\"\n\n4=Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi posting on a forum as Abu Dujanah al-Khurasani\n\nJarret Brachman, consultant to the US government on terrorism said in a telephone interview to The New York Times, \"He’s one of the most revered authors on the jihadists' forums. He’s in the top five jihadists. He's one of the biggest guns out there.\"\n\nEvan Kohlmann, who tracks jihadi Web sites for NBC News said, \"He was actually an administrator on the now-defunct Al-Hesbah forum, previously al-Qaeda's main chat forum.\"\n\nThe bombing last Wednesday at the CIA base, known as Forward Operating Base Chapman, in Afghanistan's Khowst province killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian officer.\n\nThe U.S. military's intelligence chief in Afghanistan has criticized the work of U.S. intelligence agencies operating there, saying they are \"ignorant\" and out of touch with the Afghan people. General Michael Flynn says U.S. intelligence efforts have focused too much on gathering information about insurgent groups in Afghanistan.\n\nHe says U.S. intelligence has been unable to inform U.S. and NATO forces about the environment in which they operate and the Afghan people whom they seek to persuade. His comments were published in a report issued Monday by a U.S. think tank, the Center for a New American Security.\n\nThe bodies of the seven CIA employees killed in the Khowst attack arrived Monday at a U.S. Air Force base in the East Coast state of Delaware. A small, private ceremony was held at the base, attended by friends and family and CIA Director Leon Panetta.\n\nThe bombing was the second-deadliest attack in the U.S. intelligence agency's history. In a statement, CIA spokesman George Little described the fallen employees as \"patriots who courageously served their nation.\"\n\nIn message to employees the day after the bombing, Panetta said, \"Those who fell yesterday were far from home and close to the enemy, doing the hard work that must be done to protect our country from terrorism.\"\n\nJordan's state news agency, Petra, identified the Jordanian officer killed in the bombing as Sharif Ali bin Zaid. It says he was killed while \"performing the sacred duty of Jordanian forces in Afghanistan.\" NATO says Jordan has seven troops in Afghanistan.\n\nNBC News says Bin Zaid was an intelligence agent and a first cousin of Jordan's King Abdullah II. Both the Afghan Taliban and Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack.",

Dexia specialises in finance to local governments but also runs standard retail banking outlets in Belgium and France. It will cease proprietary trading as part of the restructuring.\n\nThe bank will sell its U.S. bond insurance arm Financial Security Assurance to Assured Guaranty. Dexia Banka Slovensko in Slovakia will be retained, as will the company's Italian, Spanish and Portuguese public finance operations. In total, some 900 jobs will be lost.\n\nDexia will not pay a dividend or management bonuses this year, whilst board members have taken a 50% pay cut. The bank ran into trouble last year as a result of the failure of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent collapse of confidence in the banking system worldwide. The governments of France, Belgium and Luxembourg stepped in to guarantee the bank's survival, although the bank was not nationalized, and the previous executive management was removed. The bank's current chairman is Jean-Luc Dehaene, a former prime minister of Belgium.",

The Chief Surgeon said, \"Sharon is out of danger, for the moment. His condition is stable and the surgery was a success.\" Sharon is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital.\n\nYesterday doctors treating Sharon had noticed a swollen abdomen and ordered a CT scan on his torso and found the damage to his intestine. Later tests had shown that part of the large intestine had developed necrosis and needed to be immediately removed.\n\nHospital director Shlomo Mor-Yosef stated a press conference that there were \"no complications\" during surgery. \"His (Sharon's) key problem is lack of consciousness. There is no significant change in his condition. Doctors did not find any occluded artery and there were no blood vessels blocked. He is stable but in critical condition at this time and he is in no immediate danger at this moment.\"\n\nYosef also said that Sharon's sons and family had met earlier and decided to go forward with the surgery and treatment.\n\nDoctors removed at least 50cm of Sharon's large intestine.\n\nYosef also said that possible reasons as to why Sharon's intestine was damaged were, \"maybe infection or decline of blood supply to the intestine.\" Yosef also said that the surgery was both a \"routine procedure\" and \"not a dramatic\" one. \"Hospitals perform these operations sometimes two or three times a day,\" he added.\n\nYael Bossem-Levy, a spokesman for Hadassah Medical Center said earlier that, \"the prime minister's life is in danger. His condition is now very serious, or critical. Sharon's digestive tract has undergone severe deterioration while he's been unconscious, and there appears to be a blockage in his blood circulation. The restricted blood flow raised the possibility of necrosis, or death of tissue, in the intestines.\"\n\nLevy also stated that Sharon's condition has \"deteriorated to its most critical point since his admission.\"\n\nThe 77 year-old leader has been hospitalized since January 4th, after suffering a massive stroke which left him comatose. This is his seventh surgery since his hospitalization.\n\nSharon has been hospitalized for thirty-nine days, and has been on a feeding tube for two weeks.",

Humberto was expected to pass by Bermuda late Wednesday night.\n\nThe NHC's \"Hurricane Humberto Intermediate Advisory Number 25A\", released at 8:00 p.m. AST on Wednesday (0000 UTC Thursday morning) placed Humberto 75 miles (120 kilometers) north of Bermuda. At the time, Humberto had maximum sustained winds of 120 miles per hour (195 kilometers per hour) and was moving east-by-northeast at 20 mph (31 kph).\n\nThe NHC predicted that Humberto would pass by Bermuda Wednesday night, before beginning to weaken on Thursday. The advisory also noted dangerous surf conditions, with waves over 30 feet high being recorded offshore by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) buoy, warning of a possibility of coastal flooding.\n\nBermuda was rarely hit by hurricanes according to CNN who reported that over the last century, only 21 hurricanes reached within 100 miles of the islands. The most recent hurricane to reach Bermuda, Hurricane Gonzalo, made landfall there in 2014.\n\nHurricanes are a form of tropical cyclones. On the Saffir–Simpson scale used by the NHC for classifying tropical cyclones, a category 3 hurricane must sustain winds of at least 111 miles per hour. The cut-off for a category 4 hurricane, the next stronger classification, is 130 mph. Hurricanes classified as category 3 or above are considered to be \"major\" hurricanes.",

Current patients are being cared for in the NICU and Sunnybrook has created a separate area to accommodate new babies.\n\nThe closure of the NICU at Women's College Hospital is expected to put a strain on availability of high-risk neo-natal services in Ontario. According to Sunnybrook, the NICU cares for one in five of all babies born in Ontario weighing less than three pounds.\n\nHead of Sunnybrook's department of newborn and developmental pediatrics, Dr. Michael Dunn, suggests that some patients of the NICU will need to be transferred to other facilities to allow for intensive cleaning of the area.\n\nIn a CBC interview, Dunn explains that, \"all the babies who developed infections have been successfully treated, but we were not able to completely prevent the spread of the organism from one baby to another.\"\n\nNew patients will have to be diverted to other facilities in the province of Ontario or even out of country. Buffalo, New York in the United States may be a potential destination for some women in Ontario with high-risk pregnancies or premature babies.\n\nAccording to a Sunnybrook press release, the High Risk Perinatal Service will remain closed until there are no new transmissions of the Staphylococcus aureus bacterium. It further explains that outbreaks in the NICU are rare and that several measures have been put in place to keep the bacterium from spreading. The hospital has isolated babies who have symptoms and are ensuring that a specific team of clinicians only treat the affected babies.\n\nThe Sunnybrook press release suggests that, although MRSA bacteria are commonly found on the skin of newborns, the organism that has surfaced in the NICU has caused a variety of infections to the skin and eyes of the babies. The babies in the NICU are, apparently, responding to antibiotic treatment.",

The implementation of this declaration is very important for the establishment of an orderly regime on the Ukrainian-Moldovan border to which the EU attaches great importance.\" Solana added also: \"I call on the economic agents of the Transnistrian region of Moldova to register with the relevant authorities in Chisinau in order to promote the unimpeded flow of goods across the border.

    "original_text": "WikimediaMention\n\nEdits by Massachusetts congressman Marty Meehan's staff on his Wikipedia article spurred a Lowell Sun story and a subsequent Wikipedia investigation of all Internet addresses assigned to the Congress of the United States.\n\n__NOTOC__\n\n2006-01-29\nWhile edits from the Capitol are not generally news, the biographical article for Mr. Meehan was carefully edited, removing negative comments while expanding with content from the congressman's political flyer. The IP address which made these edits has an extensive editing history on Wikipedia, and has been repeatedly blocked in past months for article vandalism and violation of Wikipedia policies ( Wikipedia's log of 143.231.249.141 being blocked from editing).\n\nWikipedia administrators, alerted to the Marty Meehan article edits, realized that many edits to politically-sensitive articles had been made from IP addresses assigned to the US Capitol building, and have begun an investigation into all edits from such addresses.\n\nAt the center of the investigation are edits by the IP address 143.231.249.141, which is the proxy through which most of the U.S. House Internet traffic passes. Jon Brandt, spokesman for the Committee on House Administration confirmed House ownership of the IP . An aide for Rep. Meehan made two edits to the article on Meehan's biography. The first was on July 18, 2005 and replaced the article with his official biography, which was biased towards Meehan. A later edit on December 27, 2005 removed text referring to Mr. Meehan's pledge to only run four terms, or 8 years.\n\nThe text that was removed said \"He also ran on a platform of term limits. However, after serving four terms as US Congressman, the number of terms he pledged that he and no other congressman should serve out, he has since gone back on his word and now is adamently sic against the idea of term limits for Congressmen.\"\n\nThe text was replaced with: \"His fiscally responsible voting record since then has earned him praise from citizen watchdog groups.\"\n\nCongressman Meehan has served seven terms as Representative of his home state of Massachusetts.\n\nMost of the edits from Capitol Hill IPs have not been harmful edits. Many edits have been made which were neutral, correcting factual, spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. A sampling of both positive and harmful edits to politically-related articles are included here.\n\nThe communications director for Rep. Joe Wilson took a different approach to editing Rep. Wilson's article. She contacted Wikipedia founder Jimbo Wales, who advised that she supply a biography on the Wikipedia article's discussion page, rather than edit the article directly, for other Wikipedia editors to check and to incorporate into the article itself. After she added the official bio to Wilson's discussion page, Wikipedia editors used it and several other sources to expand the article substantially.\n\nFollowing the reports of the edits from the House IP address, a so-called checkuser (a check of confidential information to determine the accounts used by staffers coming from that IP) was performed to determine what users logged-in with an account edited from the House IP address, and the edits made by all of those users were checked as well. They all showed little bias and no vandalism. \n\nUnlike the U.S. House, computers from the U.S. Senate are assigned individual IP addresses. To identify possible vandals, the edit history for all senators was checked, and a list of 25 addresses was extracted. While some had good faith edits, others showed unacceptable behaviour.\n\nThe entire 156.33.x.x netblock is for Senate use only \n* OrgName: U.S. Senate Sergeant at Arms\n* NetRange: 156.33.0.0 - 156.33.255.255\n\nThe following is a partial list of U.S. Senator biographies on the English-language Wikipedia edited by Senate employees.\n\n*Senator Conrad Burns' page was edited to remove negative comments as positive comments were added. \n*Senator Norm Coleman's page was also edited to remove negative comments while positive comments were added. \n*Senator Robert Byrd's page was vandalized \n*Senator Tom Harkin's criticism section was deleted , a major section on Israel &amp; military removed and later vandalized by a different IP \n*Senator Joe Biden's page had a major edit removing significant criticism \n*Senator Tom Coburn's page was vandalized more than once \n\nWhile the identity of these IPs are not known, a small sample of edits from Capitol IPs shows both helpful and harmful edits.\n\n*156.33.148.107 (contribution list)\n** This IP has had extensive edits at Wikipedia, including:\n** Improving William Swain Lee article from a stub to a full-fledged article. \n** Expanded Michael Davidson article. \n\n*156.33.150.38 (contribution list)\n** Removing negative elements from Corrine Brown bio - , \n\n*156.33.43.214 (contribution list)\n** Vandalized George W. Bush - \n** Vandalized Robert Byrd - \n\nA complete list of all the Senatorial IPs that contributed to political articles can be found here.\n\nThe attention of Wikipedia administrators was drawn to the pattern of edits to Wikipedia articles by Congressional staffers at 18:47 on January 29. In response, Wikipedia administrators began a systematic examination of all edits to articles made from IP addresses that have been assigned for use by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nAdministrators found several places where edits from U.S. Senate IP addresses had been to articles on Senators.\n\nFollowing online discussions using IRC, Wikipedia administrator FireFox blocked the U.S. House of Representatives' Wikipedia editing privileges for one week while the issue is discussed. The block was lifted shortly thereafter by a dissenting admin. \n\nWhile the Wikimedia Foundation has not yet issued a statement regarding this, Jimmy Wales was quoted by the AP discouraging the removal of facts. \"You don't delete it,\" Wales said. \"If they wanted to put in their side of things, that would seem ethically relevant, rather than just omitting it.\"",

This vote delivers a victory to environmentalists and denies the Bush administration their top energy priority. Senator Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) attached the drilling plan to a measure to fund ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the Senate late last night agreed to pass the defense bill, without the drilling provision.\n\nTwo key Republicans, Lincoln D Chafee (R-R.I.) and Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), joined Democrats in opposing the drilling. Senator Lieberman (D-Conn) said yesterday that Stevens was to blame for holding up money for the military. By including the drilling measure in the defense spending bill, it was hoped to twist the senators' arms into voting for both provisions together in the scramble to finish the important business before the Senate's Christmas break.",

As of 21:09 GMT there were six severe flood warnings (the highest alert in the UK Flood Warnings system) in force in the county, with a large number of flood warnings and watches also in force across the region.\n\nAccording to BBC News, the main street in the town of Cockermouth is under several feet of water, and around 200 people were being evacuated by helicopters. At least 350 homes in the Elliot Park district of Keswick are also reported to be without power.\n\nA number of local roads are flooded (including the A6 in Kendal). The West Coast Main Line railway is also reported as subject to disruption due to flooding between Oxenholme and Carlisle. Some mainline services are terminating\nat either Carlisle or Preston. Local services between Carlisle and Barrow are also reported to have delays.\n\nSome properties in Keswick, Cockermouth and Kendal had already been evacuated under pre-existing emergency plans.\n\nRobert Runcie, the Environment Agency's director of flood and coastal risk was quoted as saying: \"After persistent heavy rain combined with saturated ground and full rivers across Cumbria, the decision was taken to evacuate residents in towns and villages across the Lake District, before the onset of serious flooding.\"\n\n\"Since early on Thursday we have been helping emergency services coordinate community groups that are going house-to-house ensuring people were taking precautions and evacuated where necessary. These emergency plans were established following the Cumbria floods of 2005 and have worked successfully. The last thing we want is floodwater putting lives at risk.\"\n\n\"We urge people to take care and check the latest flooding situation and sign up to our free flood warnings service or by calling 08459 881188.\"\n\nEarlier Cumbrian police had advised against non essential travel, and against fell-walking entirely.\nChief Superintendent Kevin McGilloway of Cumbria Constabulary stating \"All the agencies are working together with local people to ensure they are kept as safe as possible during the severe weather which is hitting some parts of the county. We are asking people not to travel unless it is absolutely necessary.\" He also gave some advice, \"Pedestrians in areas where there are floods, such as Cockermouth, Keswick, Penrith and Kendal, are being urged not to attempt to walk through flood waters. Anyone who notices blocked drains are also being urged not to put themselves at risk by attempting to unblock them. The key message is for people who are affected by the floods to be prepared, to try and protect any properties that are liable to flooding. Look out for one another including vulnerable friends and neighbours. Anyone in affected areas should ensure they carry mobile phones, torches, waterproofs and other equipment they may need and ensure they have all essential medication with them.\"\n\nIn Kendal, demand for sandbags has been high. A spokesperson for South Lakeland council stated:\n\"More than 1,000 sandbags have already been collected from our depot and we have ordered 4,000 more to meet the demand.\"\n\nThe Mayor of Keswick praised efforts by those involved in the flood response. \"It is all hands to the pump, really\" he said. \"The emergency services are well co-ordinated and have been fantastic.\"",

Up to 300 mm of rain fell in just a few hours across the country, with swollen rivers, torrential streams and landslides sweeping away cars, houses, bridges, and whole sections of roads. In some areas, public services have not yet been restored, and healthcare and drinking water are being provided by mobile units. Some major roads are still closed. The damage includes the destruction of the resistance Hospital Franja, a museum site from the Second World war.\n\nWorst hit was the valley town of Železniki, where three people died, 350 houses were flooded and over a hundred cars were swept away by the swollen river Sora. The dead included a woman who was swept away by the river in her car. The local health facilities and the elementary school are closed. Road communication to several surrounding villages was cut off by landslides. The flood also badly damaged local industry. The lower-lying town of Škofja Loka was also badly hit by the flood. A 31-year-old volunteer fire fighter was killed during the rescue effort in Cerklje.\n\nOther badly affected areas include those along the rivers Sava, Savinja and Dravinja. All three rivers and many of their tributaries overflowed and flooded fields and towns. The low-lying parts of Celje, Laško and Nazarje were flooded by up to 2 meters of water. A 34-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman were killed in Podgorje near Braslovče when their house was buried in a landslide. Two older people managed to leave the house unharmed.\n\nDamage was widespread across the country and many roads were blocked by landslides. Velenje was cut off from the world for more than a day. The main road connecting the mountainous Bohinj valley to the central part of the country was closed, leaving only the mountain road to Tolmin.\n\nNear the town of Cerkno, which was itself flooded, the museum site of Hospital Franja was nearly completely destroyed. The partisan resistance hospital from the Second World War, situated in a narrow mountain canyon above the town and named after the young doctor who worked at the site, treated hundreds of wounded resistance fighters and remained undiscovered by the Wehrmacht throughout the war. The hospital consisted of 12 wooden cabins and a miniature hydroelectric power plant. The power plant and all but one of the wooden cabins and were swept away by the swollen stream. Hundreds of exhibits, including medicine containers, locally produced medical equipment and an x-ray machine were lost or badly damaged.\n\nThe government of Slovenia directed €500,000 from the emergency fund to immediate rescue and repair operations, and has promised to help the affected municipalities and population with funds from the budget. The government has also pledged to rebuild the Hospital Franja museum site.",

The bill specifies that only certain chronic diseases are eligible, ALS, AIDS, cancer, muscular dystrophy, and multiple sclerosis. The bill specifically bans the unlicensed growing of cannabis, driving under the influence of the drug, and only allows six licensed dispensaries in the state.\n\nOne of the supporters of the bill, Assemblyman Reed Gusciora said that “I truly believe this will become a model for other states because it balances the compassionate use of medical marijuana while limiting the number of ailments that a physician can prescribe it for”.\n\nOpponents of the bill point to California where they say that cannabis is too loosely regulated. Governor-elect Chris Christie said that \"I think we all see what’s happened in California,\" he said. \"It’s gotten completely out of control.\"",

Taking legal action against Mr Bolt were former ATSIC member Geoff Clark, academic Larissa Behrendt, native title expert Graham Atkinson, academic Wayne Atkinson, lawyer Mark McMillan, activist Pat Eatock and artist Bindi Cole. They argued Bolt's articles offended, upset and demeaned them while implying they identified as Aboriginal Australians for personal gain.\n\nBolt's lawyer, Neil Young, argued in court that the articles were a genuine reflection of his client's beliefs and were published in the public interest. \"Everything that's said, even if it's expressed colourfully, is rationally related to a thesis that's a matter of public interest,\" Mr Young had said.\n\nBolt said his writings were fair and within the provisions of free speech laws. Ron Merkel, QC, for the complainants, said his clients did not target free speech, stating that while Bolt is free to express his views, he should not have attacked the nine individuals named in the articles.\n\nJustice Bromberg told the court Bolt's articles would have offended a reasonable member of the Aboriginal community, adding that the articles were factually incorrect and not written with good faith. \"I am satisfied that each of Mr Bolt and the Herald &amp; Weekly Times engaged in conduct which contravened section 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act.\"\n\nBolt described the verdict as \"a terrible day for free speech in this country,\" adding \"It is particularly a restriction on the freedom of all Australians to discuss multiculturalism and how people identify themselves,\"\n\nMs Eatock, a prominent activist and the chief plaintiff, said she was not confident of receiving an apology from Mr Bolt. \"I will never get an apology from Mr Bolt. He made that clear giving his evidence earlier in the year,\" she said. \"But we will, I hope, get some sort of acknowledgment through the press that what he wrote was just unacceptable, totally unacceptable.

The comments were made at a party function approximately twelve hours after Brogden's suicide attempt. Abbott is also reported to have said \"I just want to make it clear I have never told an inappropriate joke, I've never pinched a woman on the backside and I never make inappropriate gestures to women\" at a Kenthurst Liberal Party branch meeting, in reference to Brogden's reported behaviour at a function approximately two months ago.\n\nThere have been calls for Abbott to resign or be sacked by Prime Minister John Howard from some sectors, such as persons involved in mental health care, as well as the Federal Opposition. They claim that the comments show that Abbott is not mindful of mental health issues when they should be foremost in his mind.\n\nThe comments were first raised with Abbott by the ABC Insiders program yesterday. He confirmed that he had made the remarks and offered to apologize \"if anyone is upset\", and later that day made such an apology. The extent of the apology was criticised in the House of Representatives in Federal Parliament that day, with Julia Gillard, the Shadow Health Minister, calling it \"half-arsed\" during debate on a motion to censure the minister for his comments. The motion was rejected as the Liberal/National coalition form Government federally.\n\nThere is suspicion that the tipoff about Abbott's comments was made by a member of the left-wing faction of the Liberal party, of which Brogden was a member, as a form of payback against members of the right-wing faction, of which Tony Abbott is a member. The Liberal right are said to have been involved in the campaign against Brogden.",

Obama signed a guestbook and dated it 2008, instead of 2011. Also, during a state banquet held at Buckingham Palace, Obama spoke over the British national anthem, \"God Save the Queen\", as he toasted Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nFootage of the banquet shows Her Majesty speaking first, then proposing a toast to the people of the United States, the President, and Mrs. Obama. The guests rise from their seats and stand at attention as the US national anthem plays. The President is seen doing a civilian salute during the anthem. The President speaks, and proposes a toast to the Queen. He says \"To Her Majesty the Queen\" too early in his speech, however, prompting the band to play the British national anthem. Nonetheless, he continues to speak over the music. When he finishes speaking, the anthem is still playing, but he turns and raises his glass to the Queen. The Queen remains standing at attention, not accepting Obama's toast, and Obama lowers his glass. Everyone finally raises their glasses in a toast once the band finishes playing the anthem.\n\nBritish Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said of the anthem blunder, \"I thought you did exactly the right thing.\" The press also has seemed to focus less on the gaffe, and more on Obama strengthening US-UK relations.\n\n\"I said to myself, 'I wonder what would have happened if George Bush signed it May of '08? I wonder if almost anybody was three years off,'\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also criticized the President's fiscal policies, especially high gas prices, rising unemployment, and the national debt. He was speaking at a two-day forum, named the Faith and Freedom Conference and Strategy Briefing, along with possible candidates for the Republican nomination for President next year. Although he announced last month that he will not seek the Republican nomination, he has still left open the possibility of running as an independent candidate.",

    "original_text": "The French National Assembly is to adopt a bill, known as DADVSI (« Droits d'Auteurs et Droits Voisins de la Société de l'Information », \"author's right and related rights in the information society\"), tomorrow. This bill reforms the French code of intellectual property (CPI) and other laws, mostly in order to implement the 2001 European directive on copyright.\n\nThe directive mandates legal protections of Digital rights management (DRM) measures against circumvention. DRMs are \"digital locks\" that prevent users from freely copying or playing contents, in order to enforce the copyright of the authors, artists, publishers and producers. The initial draft of the bill, proposed by Minister of Culture Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, made circumvention of DRMs, or even facilitation thereof, a felony (délit), with a maximal penalty of 3 years in prison and/or a €300,000 fine as with counterfeiting. Since DRMs, circumvention and facilitations were not legally defined, it was feared that the law would effectively prevent competitors from creating players, especially based on free software, compatible with major systems such as Apple's iPod or Microsoft's Windows Media Player &amp;mdash; or even to prevent the creation of any free software capable of loading files with DRM capabilities, that is, potentially most future text, audio or video file formats.\n\nThe initial draft also conserved the threat of a counterfeiting felony conviction for those exchanging copyrighted files on the Internet. This was judged to be unfairly repressive and unrealistic. In France, it is commonplace for Internet users to have broadband up to 16 megabits per second in cheaply priced (€30 a month or lower) ADSL packages, often comprising VoIP phone and television ; millions of users, especially the young, are believed to use peer-to-peer file sharing software. Lawmakers, from both the majority UMP party and the opposition, found it unwise to turn millions of citizens into potential felons. As a consequence, the Minister proposed a \"gradual\" scheme where mere downloading of one file would be punishable by a €38 fine, which was adopted as an amendment. It remains to be seen how the law will be enforced.\n\nWith respects to DRMs, lawmakers from both the majority UMP party, the centrist Union for French democracy and the opposition adopted amendments that make it compulsory for publishers of DRM-encumbered content to give the specifications to whomever would like to implement a compatible player. This proposal was decried by some US news sources as targeting Apple Computer's iTunes system, tied to the iPod players. It is yet unknown, though, if these amendments would apply to companies that choose not to claim the new special protection awarded to DRMs by the law, which enable them to sue those who implement software meant to circumvent their protections.\n\nLawmakers also expressed concerns that the proposed law would weaken existing legal exceptions to copyright, especially the right for users to make copies of copyrighted files for private use (CPI L122-5).\n\nThe lawmaking process was quite a bumpy one. In December, lawmakers adopted a surprise amendment that would legalize peer-to-peer sharing as \"private copy\", much to the dismay of the Minister of Culture. The amendment, proposed by a bipartisan coalition of majority UMP and opposition lawmakers, was the first in a series that would have established a system known as the \"global license\" through which Internet users would have paid a flat fee in exchange for an authorization to use peer-to-peer services. The fees collected would be redistributed to authors and performers. In March, the Minister tried to withdraw article 1 of the law, which was the one that was amended to his dislike, but the next day he had to reintroduce it because withdrawing it may have been unconstitutional. The Assembly then voted the article down and adopted an Article 1 \"bis\", essentially an amended version of article 1 without the legalization of peer-to-peer sharing.\n\nThe law, initially presented as an uncontroversial, technical text, soon became a hot topic. Some lawmakers, both from the opposition and the majority, decried intense lobbying by the entertainment industry. Some amendments were nicknamed the \"Vivendi Universal amendment\", from the name of a major entertainment company that some lawmakers and commentators claim has inspired them. UMP lawmakers such as Bernard Carayon denounced pressures and even blackmail from some powerful lobbies.\n\nThe Assembly will very probably adopt the bill on March 21, despite the opposition of some UMP, UDF and opposition lawmakers. The bill will then be sent to the French Senate for further amendment and approval. Since the government declared the bill to be urgent, it is probably that after examination by the Senate, the bill will be sent to a mixed Assembly/Senate commission for harmonization, then finally voted. Given that some UMP and opposition lawmakers have voiced concerns about the constitutionality of some episodes of the lawmaking process, it is likely that the bill will get sent to the Constitutional Council for constitutional review. Finally, president Jacques Chirac is likely to sign it into law.",

    "original_text": "In an analysis published on Friday in Science, scientists announced data collected from the Curiosity Rover show that Mars's Gale Crater was once a chemically stratified lake, meaning the aquatic environment differed markedly between deep and shallow water. According to the report, \"all of the physical, chemical, and energetic conditions necessary to establish a habitable environment were present on Mars between ~3.8 billion and 3.1 billion years ago.\"\n\nAnalysis shows the chemical index of alteration fluctuated over time in a way that suggested the lake varied between hot, wet periods and colder, drier periods. The shallow water would have been rich in oxidants brought in from the atmosphere and groundwater, and the deeper water would have been oxidant poor. Phosphates, carbon, nitrogen, iron and sulfur, indicating chemistry suitable for life, have also been found there in a variety of compounds.\n\nLead author Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University explained, \"These were very different, co-existing environments in the same lake... This type of oxidant stratification is a common feature of lakes on Earth, and now we've found it on Mars. The diversity of environments in this Martian lake would have provided multiple opportunities for different types of microbes to survive.\"\n\nThe scientists also evaluated the fineness of the sediment, meaning the sizes of individual particles of dirt, dust and sand. Curiosity found larger grains near the edges of the lake where sediments from incoming rivers and streams would have fed it, and smaller ones in what would have been the deep lakebed, which is consistent with particles dropping out of the water as the current slows down. \"We could tell something was going on,\" Hurowitz said in a statement. \"What was causing iron minerals to be one flavor in one part of the lake and another flavor in another part of the lake? We had an 'Aha!' moment when we realized that the mineral information and the bedding-thickness information mapped perfectly onto each other in a way you would expect from a stratified lake with a chemical boundary between shallow water and deeper water.\"",

Four Iraqi civilians are reported wounded.\n\nThe explosion occurred near the gates to the prison camp, and comes on the heels of a large attack earlier on Saturday, where both US soldiers and Iraqi detainees were injured. The apparent motive of the Saturday attack was to free detainees.\n\nThe New York Times reports that an official of the Interior Ministry said a letter was written by a woman who claims to be a detainee at the prison. In the letter, she reportedly begs to have the prison attacked to save her from the dishonor of rape by her American captors. The letter was circulated among Sunni mosques.\n\nAn internet posting by the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi claims responsibility for both the Abu Ghraib attacks. The Al Qaeda militant group also claimed responsibility for the first attack.\n\nThe report of the tractor bombing came as military officials were announcing that a short riot broke out Friday in another American prison called Camp Bucca. Rocks were thrown and tents set on fire during a protest over several prisoners who were being transferred. Four guards and twelve prisoners were injured.\n\nThe Camp Bucca facility holds about 6,000 detainees, while Abu Ghraib holds 3,300.",

The plasma, a cloud of rapidly moving hydrogen gas atoms and subatomic particles, is expected to reach us late Tuesday. The plasma will interact with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, which will cause northern lights, or aurora borealis, to be visible much further south than is usual. Northern lights usually appear as green or red rivers of lights across the sky.\n\n\"It's the first major Earth-directed eruption in quite some time\" said astronomer Leon Golub of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.

However, it left a loophole for broadcasters, allowing them to make the switch anytime between February 17 and June 12.\n\n\"During these challenging economic times, the needs of American consumers are a top priority of my administration,\" President Obama said in a statement about the DTV Delay Act. \"Millions of Americans, including those in our most vulnerable communities, would have been left in the dark if the conversion had gone on as planned, and this solution is an important step forward as we work to get the nation ready for digital TV.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said that 681 of the nearly 1,800 television broadcast stations in the United States would cease broadcasting in the old analog format on the original February 17 date.\n\nOwners of analog TV sets will need a converter box, for which there has been a US$1.5 billion federal program of $40 coupons for such boxes, which will allow them to view digital programming on analog televisions.\n\nThe three 'major' networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, have pledged to continue broadcasting in analog, but they only own about 100 of the 1,800 stations.\n\nNBC affiliate, WDTN said that it would continue to broadcast public safety information over the analog signals, but that it had done research that showed most viewers were ready for the switch.\n\n\"It's what we've been telling viewers all along,\" Lisa Barhorst said, explaining why WDTN would go forward with the February 17 switch.\n\n\"Next week is not going to be pretty,\" Michael Copps, the acting chairman of the FCC, said on Wednesday. \"There is going to be consumer dislocation and confusion next week.\"\n\n\"Our next few days are pretty much spoken for at the FCC,\" Copps added. \"That's not how I would have hoped to be spending my time as acting chairman.\"\n\n\"There's always going to be a certain percentage of people who won't be ready,\" Wayne Simons, general manager of CBS affiliate WINK-TV, said. \"We won't be any more prepared June 12 than we are right now.\"",

It features more than 1,800 shows put on by 17,000 performers in 260 venues.\n\nThe Fringe now dominates the group of annual arts festivals that draw 750,000 visitors to Edinburgh every year, last year 1.3 million tickets were sold for Fringe shows. Anyone can register, pay a fee, find a venue and put on a show at the Fringe, famous for its quirky choice of venues - this year, they include a double-decker bus, a swimming pool, tree and a toilet; and \"Hamlet\" is being performed in a bouncy castle.\n\nAn estimated 160,000 people watched the Fringe Festival Cavalcade, a jamboree of more than 3000 marchers, which marks the launch of the Fringe.\n\nFringe director Gudgin urged audiences to be selective, saying that it would take five years, 11 months and 16 days to see all the shows back-to-back. The Festival is scheduled to end in August 28.\n\nA recent Edinburgh City Council study concluded the Fringe brought more than £75m to the local economy each year. The festival's job openings included rickshaw drivers, show announcers to shouts details of the impending show and tell the audience when it is time to take their seats, and collectors to pick up flyers that people throw away.\n\nSeveral shows sold out in a strong opening weekend, including those by comedians Russell Brand, the \"people's poet\" Pam Ayres in his maiden Fringe venture and One Man Star Wars at the Underbelly. Comedians Jason Byrne, Simon Amstell and Danny Bhoy along with shows such as Best of the Fest and Ella Meets Marilyn starring Sally Lindsay and Rain Pryor are expected to join the list.\n\nThe Assembly venue, with theatres on George Street and the 800 Assembly Hall on the Royal Mile, said it had sold 97,000 tickets by last Friday - more than the entire number it sold in 1999.\n\nAustralian comic Wil Anderson lays into the Catholic Church, including a send up of the late Pope John Paul II. Breaking the Pope is about the infamous Magdalene laundries, religious-run workhouses for women in Ireland that existed until the mid-90s. \"Mary and The Stripper\" contrasts the tales of Mary Magdalene and a 21st-century stripper hooked on heroin.\n\nDanish-Egyptian comedian Omar Marzouk performs a standup routine on the Prophet Mohammed cartoon controversy.\n\nWe Don't Know Shi'ite, uses vox pops in the streets of Britain to highlight ignorance about Islam. The play's director Joshua Blackstone said, \"Britain could work so much better as a multi-ethnic society if people were more open-minded. We could put to rest the stereotypes if there is more understanding,\"\n\nRev Donald Reid, a spokesman for the Festival of Spirituality and Peace, a religious gathering that runs alongside the Fringe, welcomed the focus on religion, calling it a reflection of an upsurge in the thirst for faith and spirituality.\n\n\"Artists are testing the boundaries of how far they can go ... But religion should be able to be commented on and its absurdities pointed out.\", he said.\n\nIn Bible Babel Live! the Bible is read, in English, Greek and Chinese, from start to finish in 80 hours over 10 days .\n\nSpeaking of the religious motif, the festival director Paul Gudgin said, \"Clearly it's a very personal subject that artists and writers currently feel a particular need to explore,\".\n\n\"It's either about what is happening with radical Islam or reflects interest and concern over the influence Evangelical Christians seem to be having in the United States,\" he told Reuters. Pointing to a \"Da Vinci Syndrome\", he said, \"All of a sudden, these topics are of huge interest. What has surprised me is the breadth of shows on offer.\".\n\nThe religious theme received further impetus from the Racial and Religious Hatred Act introduced in the UK, which sought to give all faiths equal protection, was condemned by comedians such as Rowan Atkinson who feared it would turn satire into a criminal offence.\n\nJesus: The Guantanamo Years is a one-man show by Abie Philbin Bowman, is playing to sell-out houses. In the show, Bowman plays Jesus, a bearded Middle Eastern man arrested by U.S. immigration officials and sent to the Guantanamo detention center in Cuba after confessing he was ready to die as a martyr.\n\nBowman says comedy can be an effective weapon if used responsibly. \"Being Irish and having grown up in the 1980s I have a sense of my own culture having been hijacked by terrorists and people assuming all Irish were terrorists,\" he said.\n\nPetrol Jesus Nightmare, from the Traverse Theatre Company features two Israeli soldiers holed up under fire, an apocalyptic thriller about the violent consequences of faith has been seen as \"prescient\" of the ongoing Middle-east violence.\n\nThe Black Jew Dialogues and According to Jesus were other shows on offer. The Situation Comedy is a play from Israel about a suicide bombing written and performed by Robbie Gringras. According to Gringras, it was inspired by true events, including suicide bombings in Israel.\n\nThe Scotsman newspaper's theater critic Joyce McMillan called the Fringe \"the most amazing barometer of world politics,\" The Fringe tackled terrorism last year, following the July 2005 London bombings.\n\nIn Breasts and Burgers, a surrealist spectacle adapted from a play by 20th-century avant-gardist Guillaume Apolliniare - the US flag is ripped apart onstage each night. Cecile Shea, the US consul in Scotland, has said the play could cause hurt to ordinary Americans.\n\nDirector Richard Franklin defended it as a comment on freedom of speech. \"The most serious thing to come out of the war on terror is the excuse to create legislation against this freedom (of speech)\" he told the Herald newspaper, \"It is a symbolic thing and is intended as such.\"\n\nAn American tourist John McCabe visiting Edinburgh was unconvinced, saying \"It seems the Stars and Stripes is an acceptable target in this liberal environment,\" and \"I doubt the desecration of the Koran on stage would be tolerated. Free speech is one thing, but where's the proportionality? I certainly would not go and see this play.\"\n\nActor Mel Smith, who plays Winston Churchill in Allegiance had to go without lighting the trademark cigar, as smoking in an enclosed public space is now a crime in Scotland. Officials threatened to close down the theater, the Assembly Rooms, if he lit up.\n\n\"I think it's absurd. In the context of an international festival like this, it's crazy. It's integral to the part of Churchill and it doesn't affect other people - it's just absurd.\", William Burdett-Coutts, who runs the Assembly Rooms, said.\n\nOrganisers of the Show have called for more funding, both from public sources as well as from private businesses, to help the show.\n\nAnthony Alderson, the director of The Pleasance, told The Scotsman newspaper that without further private sector funding the Fringe could start to shrink and lose its standing as the world's best festival. He feared that the current rate of expansion is unsustainable without further support from businesses. The Fringe\ndirector Paul Gudgin said last year that the Festival would need to make a string of cutbacks if it was to combat major losses.\n\nThe Fringe Society currently receives only £45,000 a year from the city council and £25,000 from the Scottish Arts Council.\n\nGudgin also called for an urgent Scottish Executive response to the Thundering Hooves report into the future of Edinburgh's festivals, published this May. It pointed out that the festivals contribute £184 million a year to the Scottish economy and stressed the need for continued investment, long-term planning, and international promotion to beat off competition from other cities.\n\nThe Edinburgh City Council responded within a month with the announcement of a £1m fund for the various festivals. Some have argued that this money was already in the pipeline.\n\nThe Edinburgh City Council has announced increases in theatre licence fees, which venues must pay before holding a show. For venues with 200 seats or less, fees go up from £127 in 2005 to £440 this year, £620 next year and £800 in 2008. For venues seating more than a thousand, fees went up from £295 last year to £1,320 this year.\n\nThe Fringe Society, which represents the festivals managers and performers said it was \"deeply concerned about the council's decision to make these sharp increases in theatre licence prices\", adding that \"particularly the smaller venues who will suffer,\".\n\nThe Council said new laws meant the costs of its licensing scheme had to be recovered from venues. Councillor Jack O'Donnell, convener of the licensing regulatory committee, said the scheme had been operating at a deficit of £177,000.\n\n* Edinburgh Festival Fringe website",

Authorities from the United States, Japan, and South Korea confirm that the rocket lifted off at 11.32 local time (02.32 GMT) on Sunday April 5, 2009.\n\n\"A short time ago a flying object appeared to have been launched from North Korea,\" read a statement by the Japanese government. The rocket seems to have passed over the Japanese capital of Tokyo and headed over the Pacific Ocean. Two parts of the rocket, the first and second stages, fell either side of the Japanese home islands, falling into the Sea of Japan and the Pacific.\n\nA statement by the North Korean official news agency said that the rocket had successfully launched a satellite which is now broadcasting \"data\" and North Korean propaganda songs. A South Korean source told the South Korean Yonhap news agency that the rocket did appear to be carrying a satellite. The North Korean statement calls the rocket Unha-2 (\"Galaxy-2\") and the satellite Kwangmyŏngsŏng-2 (\"Lodestar 2\").\n\nHowever, the US Northern Command stated that the launch of the rocket failed, and that the payload and second stage have fallen into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nPresident Obama of the United States condemned the launch as \"provocative\" and stated that \"North Korea has ignored its international obligations...and further isolated itself from the community of nations.\" America, Japan and South Korea will discuss the launch at an emergency UN Security Council meeting at 15:00 EDT (1900 GMT).\n\nPyongyang's one ally, China, has called for \"restraint\" on all sides. Both China and fellow veto power Russia oppose further sanctions on North Korea.\n\nResolution 1718 enacted in the wake of a stated 2006 nuclear weapons test bans North Korea from missile development. North Korea claims that the rocket is a launch vehicle to orbit a satellite, however its neighbours suggest that this is simply a cover for a long-range missile test, a missile that could potentially hit Alaska and the West Coast of the United States.",

    "original_text": "Indonesia\nThe death toll from the weekend suspension bridge collapse on the Indonesian island of Borneo has risen from four to eleven. Search and rescue teams continue to look for bodies in the Mahakam River.\n\nThe number of wounded is currently 39 injured; reports from locals suggest 33 people remain missing at the scene in East Kalimantan's Kutai Kartanegara district, where \"Kalimantan's Golden Gate Bridge\" linked the towns of Tenggarong and the regional capital, Samarinda. A six-month-old baby is among the dead.\n\nCars, motorbikes, and buses all fell into the Mahakam River when the bridge came down during repairs. Another car was left overturned and balanced upon wreckage over the water. State-owned builders PT Hutama Karya completed the bridge about a decade ago in the image of California's Golden Gate Bridge. A cable on the 720-metre structure is thought to have failed as workers dealt with it; six of the repair crew were reported missing yesterday. It had been the longest suspension bridge in Borneo.\n\nEyewitnesses described heavy traffic at the time of the collapse, and one survivor said he left his truck to investigate a traffic jam. Some people were left trapped by debris as the bridge came down. \"It happened so fast, only about 30 seconds,\" according to National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo Nugoroho.\n\nNational search and rescue head Daryatmo said yesterday cranes will attempt to move debris today, with new reports saying echo-sounding equipment will be used to check it is safe to begin lifting. It is believed the bodies of more victims will be found trapped in vehicles beneath the water, which is 35-40 metres deep. Visibility is poor, and one official explained authorities are still unsure how many vehicles are on the riverbed.\n\n\"The above-water search is continuing, but underwater operations have not been carried out because we're worried that the bridge's pylons are unstable and could collapse any time,\" said Nugoroho today. He explained that bodies had washed onto the riverbanks overnight and were recovered today.\n\nThe president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, has sent three ministers to the site to investigate the accident, while Bambang Widaryatmo, head of East Kalimantan's police, promised \"parties found to be negligent will be prosecuted\". The government has promised a replacement ferry service. The river is closed to boats as rescue operations continue, and a 22-strong team has been dispatched from the national police, comprising six forensics experts, five disaster victim identification specialists, and eleven investigators. They are there to augment the East Kalimantan Police. Health Minister Endang Rahayu Sedyaningsih yesterday visited survivors in Parikesit Hospital and promised them medical treatment at government expense.\n\nSome people swam ashore after falling, with the aftermath filled with screams. Survivor Syakrani, 24, yesterday asserted \"The authorities should have closed the bridge if it was under repair.\" His words were followed by a Jakarta Globe editorial declaring the accident \"unacceptable\".\n\nThe Globe went on to comment upon suggestions corruption may have played a role; \"It is too early to point fingers and look to place blame, but if shoddy materials were used in the building of the bridge, those responsible must answer to the public.\" Another suggestion is coal barges striking the bridge may have weakened it. Local coal company Harum Energy lost five percent of its share value today amid fears the river blockage will hamper their ability to ship coal.\n\nSamarinda's seen a population and construction boom lately. A few years have seen the population triple and the construction of a large mosque, and a sports stadium; an airport and port are set to follow. However, the Corruption Eradication Commission warns 70% of the corruption it investigates concerns government contracts and up to 40% of money earmarked for infrastructure ends up stolen.",

As a result of this violation, the Department also violated the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. sect. 1341.\"\n\nThe report goes on to describe the history of the contract between the United States Department of Education, Ketchum, and Armstrong Williams. The report also describes the Department's own defense of its position, \"the Department argued that it contracted only for television and radio advertisements featuring Mr. Williams.35 Talbert Letter at 2. The Department offered three points in support of its position: First, the only portions of its Statements of Work that have any legal significance are the lists of “deliverables.” The Department argues that its task orders did not procure Mr. Williams’s commentary, which meant there was nothing for the Department to disclose. Second, the Department did not pay any appropriated funds for covert propaganda. Third, the Department’s task orders represented the legitimate dissemination of information to the public. Id. We do not agree.\"\n\nThe report conlcudes, \"The Department of Education violated the fiscal year 2004 publicity or propaganda prohibition by contracting with Ketchum for the services of GWG to obtain commentary by Armstrong Williams on the NCLB Act without requiring Ketchum to ensure that Mr. Williams disclosed to his audiences the Department’s role. The commentary obtained as a result of these contracts violated the publicity or propaganda prohibition because it was “covert,” in that it did not disclose to the targeted audiences that it was sponsored by the Department and was paid for using appropriated funds. E.g., B-303495, Jan. 4, 2005; B-302710, May 19, 2004. At the same time, because the Department had no appropriation available to contract for commentary in violation of the cited publicity or propaganda prohibitions, the Department also violated the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. sect. 1341.

    "original_text": "China\n\nHeavy June rainfall has forced China to evacuate more than 550,000 people from their homes. Massive floods have devastated the central and southern parts of the country, causing rivers to overflow their banks and triggering mudslides. The rains follow the worst drought in China in over 50 years, which has decimated crop yields.\nMinistry of Civil Affairs\nOverall, 40 rivers have risen above safe limits, stressing dykes and dams including those on China's largest waterway, the Yangtze River, which is flooding downstream while experiencing a severe drought near its source in the north.\n\nChina's disaster level has been raised to four, the highest on the scale. In a statement on its website on Friday, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs said, \"Since June 13, the damage caused by the rainstorms has led to ... the emergency evacuation of 671,200 people to safety.\"\n\nThe current round of heavy rains began in early June. Since then, more than a million and a half people have been displaced in the central and southern regions of the country and at least 168 deaths have been reported. Meteorologists in Beijing are predicting more heavy rain in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Zhejiang this weekend.\nsource=Chinese villager\nThe government has mobilized its forces to aid in the massive evacuations. According to Reuters, local authorities are distributing a box of instant noodles and a carton of bottled water to those affected by the flood. But villagers have reported that survival is difficult, especially for those still trapped by the flood waters in small villages, and distribution of aid is slow, with some not receiving any.\n\nA villager was quoted by Reuters: \"To be frank, those rescue boats cannot go through those narrow lanes inside the village. A lot of them depend on their relatives rowing small wooden boats to get to them... It is hard to help these people inside there.\" Another villager, Shou Pengfei said, \"Some did not even get any relief items. There is no electricity and you get bitten by mosquitoes all the time.\"\nsource=Shou Pengfei, A Chinese villager\nAccording to the Beijing Climate Centre, weather trends have shifted drastically. Currently the rain is coming in shorter but fiercer bursts, with protracted periods of drought in between the torrential rain.\n\nThe heavy rainfall is not likely to reduce the crop failure caused by months of drought, especially in the north, the heart of China's grain-growing bread basket, where many rivers have dried up. According to reports, the northern countryside has been left devastated by the droughts. Huge dams hundreds of meters wide are now small, muddy pools. Large cities such as Beijing are draining the underground water sources and China is facing a long-term water crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, China is engaged in a huge multi-year engineering project designed to move water to the parched north and away from the flooded south. The North-South water project is a massive series of canals and pipes designed to carry water from the Yangtze and Yellow rivers to Beijing.\n\nIt is likely, analysts predict, that Chinese crop shortages will increase food prices worldwide. Even before the latest flooding, the severe drought in the north caused a shortfall in China's crop yields that will likely affect the price of wheat and may propel a price increase in global markets.",

    "original_text": "Apple\nlowercase\n\nThe new version of Apple Inc.'s tablet computing device, the iPad 2, has gone on sale in the United States at Apple Stores and a number of other retailers (including Wal-Mart, Target, Sam's Club, Best Buy, Verizon, and AT&amp;T), a shift from last year's launch which was only available through Apple's stores. The product will go on sale internationally on March 25.\n\nThe device was announced on March 2 at an event at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, California. CEO Steve Jobs emerged from sick leave to make the announcement.\n\nThe iPad 2 has an all-new design and has several improvements over the original iPad. The device runs on a dual-core Apple A5 CPU. According to Jobs, the CPU's new dual-core capability enhances multitasking and doubles the processing speed. Apple additionally introduced a magnetic 'Smart Cover' accessory that snaps to the front screen of the device along with several new apps ported from the Mac OS X operating system and the iPhone. These include iMovie, GarageBand, and Photo Booth. The new iPad introduces front and rear cameras which enable FaceTime and video. The new tablet is fifteen percent lighter and 33 percent thinner than the previous version—thinner than an iPhone 4—and has beveled edges. It is available in black and white and continues to be capable of ten hours of battery life on a single charge.\n\nThe announcement came after months of rumors about the successor to the original iPad. Competitors have designed tablets to compete with the iPad, such as Motorola's Xoom powered by the Android operating system. Apple, who normally follows a yearly product cycle, has pressed its iPad successor into the marketplace almost a full month earlier than usual.\n\nTablet computers have existed for years but, until recently, have not been popular amongst consumers. Tablet sales totaled 90,000 in 2009. Apple sold nearly fifteen million iPads worldwide in 2010, generating US$2 billion in revenue within three months. In 2010, Apple held a 75% share of the tablet computer market. According to one analyst, even with competition, iPads will still make up at least 20 million of the more than 24 million tablet computers sold in the United States in 2011. An analyst predicted 'conservatively' that 35 million iPad 2s will be sold in 2011. One analyst credits Apple's enormous App Store for the iPad's continued domination. Apple also holds an advantage in price over other tablets, many of which are still first generation devices. An analyst at J.P. Morgan predicts an overabundance of tablets caused by faltering demand. This could have drastic effects on competitors.\n\nThe iPad connects to the Internet over Wi-Fi and 3G models of the new device can connect to the wireless networks of AT&amp;T or Verizon Wireless. The iPad 2 will start at US$499—the same starting price of the original iPad. The equivalent model of the original iPad has been reduced to US$399.\n\nclear\n\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/2007 till:05/31/2011\nDefine $now = 04/11/2011\nDefine $skip = at:end # Force a blank line\nDefine $dayunknown = 15 # what day to use if it's actually not known\nImageSize= width:900 height:auto barincrement:25\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nPlotArea = right:1 left:1 bottom:30 top:1\n\nColors =\nid:bg value:white\nid:lightline value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.9)\nid:lighttext value:rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5)\nid:server value:rgb(0.8,0.8,0.9)\nid:touch1 value:rgb(1,1,0.8)\nid:touch2 value:rgb(1,1,0.65)\nid:touch3 value:rgb(1,1,0.5)\nid:touch4 value:rgb(1,1,0.35)\nid:phone value:rgb(0.75,1,0.55)\nid:phone2 value:rgb(0.65,1,0.55)\nid:phone3 value:rgb(0.55,1,0.55)\nid:phone4 value:rgb(0.45,1,0.55)\nid:pad value:rgb(0.95,0.7,0.5)\nid:pad2 value:rgb(0.95,0.7,0.7)\nid:current value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.9)\n\nBackgroundColors = canvas:bg\nScaleMajor = gridcolor:lighttext unit:year increment:1 start:01/01/2007\nScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightline unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/2007\n\nBarData =\nbarset:touch\nbarset:phone\nbarset:pad\n\nPlotData=\nwidth:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s\n\nbarset:touch\ncolor:touch1 from:09/05/2007 till:09/09/2008 text:\"(1G) iPod Touch\"\nbarset:break\ncolor:touch2 from:09/09/2008 till:09/09/2010 text:\"(2G) iTouch\"\ncolor:touch3 from:09/09/2009 till:09/09/2010 text:\"(3G) iTouch\"\nbarset:break\ncolor:touch4 from:09/09/2010 till:$now text:\"(4G) iTouch\"\nbarset:break\ncolor:current from:$now till:end\n\nbarset:phone\ncolor:phone from:06/29/2007 till:07/11/2008 text:\"iPhone\"\nbarset:break\ncolor:phone2 from:07/11/2008 till:06/24/2010 text:\"iPhone 3G\"\ncolor:phone3 from:06/19/2009 till:$now text:\"iPhone 3GS\"\nbarset:break\ncolor:phone4 from:06/24/2010 till:$now text:\"iPhone 4\"\ncolor:current from:$now till:end\nbarset:break\ncolor:current from:$now till:end\n\nbarset:pad\ncolor:pad from:04/03/2010 till:$now text:\"iPad\"\ncolor:pad2 from:03/11/2011 till:$now text:\"iPad 2\"\nbarset:break\ncolor:current from:$now till:end",

It is the first major loss of data in the UK since information on 25 million people was lost by HM Revenue in October.\n\nIn her statement to MPs, Ruth Kelly confirmed that no banking information was contained within the lost data, nor were individuals' dates of birth. She highlighted that security measures had been taken, and that the information that had been stored was not in a format \"readily usable or accessible\" by standard means.\n\nPolitical figures in the UK continue to raise concerns about both the specific loss of this information, and the nature of governments ability to safely gather and maintain information.

The family was visiting a nearby waterfall when they were attacked.\n\nAccording to rescuers, the girl managed to escape from the bear, but was found only an hour later by a rescuer who fired shots that scared the bear away.\n\n\"Allegedly, after the rescue squad found the little girl, one of the squad members fired a shot from a small-caliber handgun. We don't know whether the bear was hit or not. There was no blood, but it chased off,\" said Dan Hicks, a spokesman for the states Wildlife Resources Agency.\n\nThe mother and the brother both remain in critical condition at a hospital in Chattanooga. The boy's skull was punctured by a bite to the head, before the bear attacked his mother. The mother was trying to scare the bear away with rocks and sticks before being attacked. According to doctors, she had several puncture wounds to her neck, but had too many other claw and teeth marks for them to count. Both are expected to recover.\n\nInvestigators have not yet been able to speak to the mother because of the severity of her injuries.\n\n\"She may not remember the attack at all,\" said Hicks, who also said that it was only Tennessee's second documented attack involving a bear.\n\n\"There is a chance that the same bear would attack someone else, so I hope they do catch him,\" said Lynn Rogers of the North American Bear Center.\n\nOfficials have baited traps with honey buns and doughnuts to try and catch the bear.\n\nAuthorities have not yet released the names of the victims.

The group today added its voice today to a growing disquiet over the worsening situation in that country, as expressed by the International Rescue Committee.\n\nIn a statement, the body’s Executive Deputy Secretary General Kate Gilmore, confirmed concerns that the Sudanese government are arming soldiers in preparation for conflict, despite signing a peace deal in May.\n\n\"Eyewitnesses in el-Fasher in North Darfur are telling us that Sudanese government military flights are flying in troops and arms on a daily basis,\" Gilmore said, urging the international community to act.\n\nThe U.N. is discussing a draft resolution today to send 20,000 troops into western Sudan to protect the 2.5 million displaced people. But the Sudanese government has rejected calls for foreign intervention, instead suggesting a 26,000-strong domestic force, which Amnesty opposes.\n\n\"How can Sudan — which appears to be about to launch its own offensive in Darfur — realistically propose being a peacekeeper in a conflict to which it is a major party and perpetrator of grave human rights violations,\" Amnesty officials asked.\n\nEvidence that Khartoum is arming in preparation for further fighting in Darfur is causing concern among governments about a future genocide. Yesterday the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Jendayi Frazer flew to the Sudanese capital to urge the government, led by Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, to accept the U.N. force.\n\n\"Darfur is on the verge of a dangerous downward spiral,\" Frazer said, criticizing the U.N. for \"foot dragging\" on the issue.\n\nThe Sudanese government are wholly against the U.N. intervention. National Congress Party chairman Ghazi Salah Eldin Atabani told journalists \"any state that sponsors this U.N. draft resolution will be regarded as assuming a hostile attitude against the Sudan.\"\n\nIf Darfur does descend into further government-sponsored conflict, the consequences would be devastating for the civilian population, according to Eric Reeves of Democracy Now:\n\n\"If this offensive takes place, there will be massive, massive civilian destruction. I think we're also likely to see a withdrawal of virtually all humanitarian workers. This will leave some 1.2 million people completely dependent on humanitarian aid, without any assistance whatsoever,\" Reeves told the Coalition for Darfur on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation for the millions of refugees on the ground is deteriorating rapidly, according to the International Rescue Committee. On Wednesday, the group released statistics which suggest as many as 200 women have been sexually assaulted since the start of July, often as they leave settlements in search of firewood and food.\n\n\"This is a massive spike in figures,\" said the IRC's Kurt Tjossem, \"we are used to hearing of 2 to 4 incidents of sexual assault per month in Kalma camp in southern Darfur\".",

    "original_text": "The federal minimum wage in the United States increased Thursday by 70 cents from US$5.85 to $6.55. This is the second of three increases to take place each year in the federal minimum wage under a law passed by Congress in 2007. Next year, the federal minimum wage is scheduled to increase to $7.25.\n\nTwenty-four states and the District of Columbia already have higher minimum wage settings than that of the Federal Government. The new minimum wage can be considered to be less than the wage level of 1997, which when adjusted for inflation, was the equivalent of $7.02. Adjusting for inflation the minimum wage 40 years ago was the equivalent of $10.06 in today's dollars, according to the U.S. Labor Department.\n\nDistrict of Columbia law sets its minimum wage to automatically be $1.00 higher than the federal minimum. Eight states will have their state minimums increase to the federal minimum. 18 states automatically follow the federal minimum, while 24 already have minimum wage rates higher than the federal minimum. These range from Washington state at $8.07, California and New York at $8.00, to Florida at $6.79. Nevada sets its minimum wage at $6.85 unless health benefits are included, in which case the minimum is $5.85. Several states have their state minimums indexed to inflation. South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana are the only states yet to set a minimum wage law.\n\nA number of cities, including San Francisco and New York, also have local minimum wage laws which set the minimum wage for jobs in those cities to figures higher than the federal minimum, and in some cases higher than the state minimum.\n\nAbout two million workers will get an increase as a result of the change. Approximately five million will receive an increase from next year's minimum wage increase.\n\nA number of small businesses will have difficulties raising prices to cover the increase in costs, while other businesses in tight labor markets indicate the increase is irrelevant as employees are already being paid more than the federal minimum.\n\n\"Government price-setting has never been good for the economy, and they are setting the price of labor,\" said William Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. \"If you want more people hired, you don't make it more expensive to hire them.\"",

The Bombardier Challenger CL-600's crash left twenty people hospitalised and prosecutors allege that regular breaches of federal law were to blame.\n\nThe business jet had been privately chartered for a flight to Chicago Midway Airport but failed to take off. Instead, the aircraft broke through a fence, crossed Route 46 and struck a warehouse, causing a fire. The plane clipped two cars on the way across the road and the accident left eleven people onboard the aircraft and nine more on the ground hospitalised.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board investigated the accident and found that the flight crew had miscalcualted the aircraft's centre of gravity and that overfilling the fuel tanks had moved it too far forward.\n\nAccording to a federal indictment filed Wednesday, six men within the company were \"routinely undertaking and concealing dangerous fueling and weight-distribution practices.\" Three co-founders of Platinum - Michael Brassington, 35, his brother Paul Brassington, 29, and Andre Budhan, 42, as well as maintenance director Brien McKenzie, also 42, have been arrested and pilot Francis Vieira, 59, and director of charters Joseph Singh, 37, are being sought.\n\nThe 23-count indictment says that Michael Brassington, McKenzie and Vieira regularly stated in paperwork that aircraft were operating at weights up to 1,000 pounds lighter than the true value in breach of Federal Aviation Administration laws. It also accuses Platinum of operating commercial charters for a year between November 2002 and November 2003 without a valid licence and filing such flights as noncommercial.\n\nThe document goes on to accuse Platinum of using pilots that lacked proper training; in particular John Kimberling, who flew the jet that crashed, was not adequatly qualified to fly commercial flights, which have stricter regulations than noncommercial air operations. He has not been charged himself at this time, but investigations continue. The Southern Ledger states the accused face charges of \"conspiracy, fraud, endangering the safety of aircraft and making false statements to the National Transportation Safety Board.\"",

The suspect was Nathaniel Brown, a 51-year-old custodial worker who has worked at the University since October. The victim of the shooting was Larry Wallington, a 48-year-old building service manager. Another employee, Henry Butler, was also shot, but survived and is in stable condition at a nearby hospital.\n\nAccording to officials, the shooting took place at 3:30 A.M. local time. Brown is said to have walked into a maintenance building with two handguns, and then commenced firing. Although police say that there were six men in the room at the time, only Wallington and Butler were shot. Within an hour of the shooting, a text message was sent out to about 25,000 students and faculty on campus alerting them of what had happened.\n\nInformation gathered following the shooting has revealed that Brown was unemployed and struggling to pay his mortgage prior to his employment at Ohio State. Although a neighbor described him as \"happy to be back at work,\" Brown's tenure at Ohio State ended quickly. Brown had learned from a recent letter from the school that he was going to be let go as of March 13. The letter went on to say that he had gotten an \"unsatisfactory\" job evaluation, and that was why he was being dismissed.",

    "original_text": "Phoenix missionThe Phoenix probe that was sent to Mars has had its mission extended. Part of Phoenix's mission was to chemically analyze soil samples, and to confirm the presence of water ice. The ice was confirmed by the use of an instrument that can identify vapours; a small sample of ice within Martian soil was heated until it melted at 0°C (32°F), the melting point for water.\n\nThe original mission was planned to be funded for a 3 months, with the cutoff in late August. However, as a result of the probe's good condition, NASA has stated that its mission will be extended by 5 weeks, till September 30.\n\n\"Phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good, so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on Mars,\" said the Head of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Michael Meyers. An additional expense of US$2 million will be incurred because of the extension, on top of the US$420 million that has already been spent. This will allow for two more trenches to be dug, which will be dubbed as \"Cupboard\" and \"Neverland\".\n\nThe Phoenix probe landed on Mars on May 25 of this year near the north pole of Mars, where the ice was discovered. The ice was found in a trench approximately 5cm deep referred to as \"Snow White\". \"It's been very successful and Mars had proven itself to be very interesting, mechanically the spacecraft is operating great, and there's plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer,\" said Meyers.\n\nThe original goal of the mission was to determine if the red planet was capable of supporting life. Phoenix is in the process of performing experiments to determine if ice ever melted in Mars' history. In addition it is searching for the organic-based compounds that are necessary for life forms to exist.\n\nPhoenix's principal investigator Peter Smith told the press conference that \"we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on Mars. It will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this environment.\"\n\nUnlike the twin Mars Exploration Rovers which has now been operating on Mars for several years, the Phoenix Lander itself is expected to cease operations entirely by the exit of 2008 when the harsh Martian polar winter takes over and the low temperatures most likely will leave the Lander's instruments irreparably damaged.",

Two others, David Mole and Khalid Mahmood have also resigned as PPSs. Parliamentary Private Secretaries are Members of Parliament appointed to assist Cabinet ministers. Blair responded by calling Watson \"disloyal, discourteous and wrong.\"\n\nWatson told BBC News he no longer believes it is in the best interests of the country for Blair to continue as prime minister.\n\nThe resignations come in spite of a report in The Sun newspaper quoting unnamed friends of the prime minister saying he would resign as Labour leader on May 31, 2007. The report has not been confirmed by Blair or his office.\n\nEarlier this week at least 14 MPs who were first elected in 2001 and were previously thought loyal to Blair, including Watson and the 6 PPSs, signed a confidential letter to Blair calling on him to publicly announce a date for his resignation. The letter was leaked to the press.\n\nConservative Leader of the Opposition David Cameron responded to the resignations by saying the government was \"divided and in meltdown\". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said that the national interest was \"not being served by the continuing uncertainty over Mr Blair\" and that the prime minister \"should either resign or set a date.\"\n\nThe mounting crisis comes two weeks before the party's annual conference being held this year in Manchester.",

Blair suggested that \"the rules of engagement do allow UK forces to take whatever measures are necessary in their own self-defence...I think that the soldiers took the right decision and did what was entirely sensible,\" said Blair in reference to the UK forces not engaging in military combat when first confronted by the Iranians.\n\nBlair also commented on the response by the crew of HMS Cornwall. \"By the time HMS Cornwall knew that our forces had been detained unlawfully by the Iranians, they were in Iranian waters, and again military engagement would have put a lot of lives at risk. I think that they took the right decision,\" said Blair.",

    "original_text": "As many as four leaks have been detected in the Deepwater Horizon well cap in the Gulf of Mexico, according to live footage shot by one of BP's ROVs (Remote Operated Vehicles). The leaks were detected early this morning, just after 4:00 (EDT).\n\nThe HOS SUPER H ROV 1 made the discovery while performing an \"integrity survey\" of the well and well cap. It recorded what appears to be a thin metal pipe lining the outside of the oil cap. Four small leaks of what appear to oil bubbles were detected during this survey. The first appears just after the elbow connecting the pipe to the two green pipes. The second can be seen through the hole of the large metal ring. The third is seen just to the right of the metal ring.\n\nIt is not yet known what the pipe carries or what it connects to. It is also not yet clear if all leaks are from the pipe, or leaking from the well. BP confirmed the leaks and told Wikinews in a phone call to their Houston, Texas press office, there is a \"small leak\" releasing hydrates consisting of gases and oil. They are \"studying the issue\" and are prepared to fix the pipe if it becomes an issue. Live camera feeds show hydrocarbons building up as the oil and gas leak from the pipe.\n\nOn July 18, ROV cameras showed bubbles coming from the base of well. BP said it would test the bubbles to determine what they are and as of Sunday, COO of BP Doug Suttles says the bubbles are not methane, but further tests are being conducted. \"If you can imagine, it is not an easy operation to collect those bubbles so that they can be tested to see what their make-up is.\"\n\nYesterday an unnamed United States official told the Associated Press that there was \"seepage\" coming from the area at the bottom of the Deepwater well head. The official said the seepage and methane gas were discovered near the Deepwater well head, but did not specify an exact location. Admiral Thad Allen, a former US Coast Guard admiral who is overseeing the spill efforts for the US government said yesterday in a letter to BP that ROVs \"detected seep a distance from the well and undetermined anomalies at the well head.\" So far there is no word what those substances are, but BP says the bubbles detected on July 18 are not of a hydrocarbon nature.\n\n\"When seeps are detected, you are directed to marshal resources, quickly investigate, and report findings to the government in no more than four hours,\" said Allen in his letter to BP. During a press conference today, Allen confirmed seepage about 3km from the well point. He could not specify whether the seep was related to the capping of the well or if it is naturally occurring.\n\nOn June 13 the Viking Poseidon ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle) 1 recorded oil and methane seeping from the seafloor at around 2:48 a.m.. The ROV monitors the seep for a minute and even gets covered in a plume of oil and sand before it moved on to the next spot. Smaller eruptions were seen as the ROV traveled. After an investigation, Wikinews determined that the seepage was located just over 50 feet from the Deepwater leak point. BP has denied that any oil or methane gas is leaking from the sea floor. On July 16, Kent Wells, the senior vice president of the company, said on their official Twitter page that \"4 ROVs using sonar scanning are looking for anomalies in seabed floor. No indications any oil or gas escaping.\"\n\nBP issued a press release earlier this morning, but did not state information regarding any leaks or seepage from the well. BP did say that the well cap \"measured at approximately 6,792 pounds per square inch and continues to rise slowly.\"\n\nThe Deepwater Horizon oil spill started on April 20 after an explosion on the rig. Efforts to put out the fire failed and the rig subsequently sank to the bottom of the Gulf. On April 22, an oil slick appeared on the surface of the Gulf. BP capped the leaking well on July 13 which effectively stopped oil from leaking into the Gulf. The company has been running a pressure integrity test on the 150,000 pound cap since it stopped the flow of oil. BP hopes for the well's pressure to rise to or above 7,500 PSI. As of Saturday morning the well's pressure was just above 6,700 PSI. BP fears anything lower than the expected PSI could mean a leak in the cap or elsewhere, such as oil or methane seeping up from the seafloor.",

    "original_text": "The non-points Nextel All-Star Challenge for the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series started with controversy and ended with a popular victory for one of the sport's veterans.\n\nMark Martin, competing in his last full Nextel Cup season, led 24 of 90 laps to win the All-Star Challenge for the second time, having done so in 1998.\n\nMartin took the lead from Elliott Sadler on the 72nd lap of the race, and never looked back, defeating Sadler by over half a second.\n\nThe Nextel All-Star Challenge is an non-points race that invites Nextel Cup race winners from the previous edition of this race to the upcoming edition, as well as former Nextel Cup Series champions, and former winners of this race. There is a last-chance transfer race, the 30-lap Nextel Open, with the winner advancing to the main event, and a second driver getting in through a fan vote, though the fan vote winner must finish on the same lap as the winner. The Nextel Open is for drivers who have never won a race, or haven't won a points-paying race in a long period of time.\n\nBrian Vickers won the Open with a move that rubbed some fans-as well as the driver he beat-the wrong way.\n\nJust over 200 yards from the finish line, Vickers tapped Open pole-sitter Mike Bliss from behind, causing him to slide across the grass and end up second. Vickers got into the All-Star Challenge itself, but Bliss, who set the track record with his pole-winning lap, was none too happy with what transpired, saying afterward, \"He spun me out. The only thing, I wish I would have turned right and wrecked (him).\" 2004 Busch Series champion Martin Truex, Jr. finished tenth in the Open, but won the fan vote to get into the All-Star Challenge.\n\nA lap 35 crash in the All-Star Challenge itself eliminated seven drivers alone, with Truex being one of them. It started when Tony Stewart tagged Joe Nemechek, who in turn hit Kevin Harvick. Kasey Kahne, Terry Labonte, and Michael Waltrip were involved as well.\n\nHarvick was upset to be involved, but he ended up taking his frustrations out on Nemechek, not on Stewart. Nemechek fired back, saying, \"Kevin thinks he owns the world, and he ain't squat....He was just being an idiot, just being Kevin.\" The accident brought out the red flag. Only one other caution took place, this being displayed on lap 71, when pole-sitter Ryan Newman spun and crashed in turn two, with teammate Rusty Wallace eventually becoming involved.\n\nThe All-Star Challenge itself is divided into three segments. The first segment is 40 laps long, the second 30, and the third and final segment 20. Mark Martin won the first segment, with Newman winning the second. Of course, Martin won the third and final segment to claim the race.\n\nFor his efforts, Martin won $1,101,325. He said over the radio that he will race in this event next year, as long as current car owner Jack Roush gives him a car. This was marked as Martin's first Nascar Nextel Cup victory since Dover on June 6, 2004.",

    "original_text": "itsdeadjim=1\nThe Chinese government released human rights activist Hu Jia from prison on Sunday after he had served over three years for subversion. His release, which had been scheduled in advance, occurred just days after controversial artist Ai Weiwei was unexpectedly released on bail after three months of detention.\n\nHu was released on the same day that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao began his visit to Britain, the first country on his three-nation Europe trade tour.\n\nDescribed by the Irish Times as a \"mild-mannered, slight figure who suffers from liver ailments\", the 37-year-old Hu is a prominent Chinese dissident who had spent years campaigning for civil liberties, environmentalism, and on behalf of suffers of HIV/AIDS before his imprisonment. He was imprisoned in April 2008 for \"inciting to subvert state power\" by writing articles about human rights in the period before the 2008 Olympic Games. He had also given many interviews to foreign news media and government embassies. He was first detained in December 2007 and his arrest came after he had spent more than 200 days under house arrest. In 2008 while in prison, he won the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought, awarded by the European Parliament.\n\nHu's wife Zeng Jinyuan said via Twitter that her husband lost his political rights upon his release and cannot speak to the media for a period of one year.\nsource=Hu Jia, human rights activist\nHu was briefly interviewed on Sunday via telephone by Hong Kong's Cable TV, and indicated that despite the danger, he would not give up his work. \"(My parents) have told me to just be a normal citizen and don't confront the system because this system is very cruel, using the country's absolute power to violate people's dignity without restraint. But I can only tell my parents I will be careful\", he said.\n\nAlthough recent releases of high-profile dissidents such as Hu and Ai may seem to some that China is loosening its repressive policies against dissidents, activists and academics said yesterday that the determination of the Chinese government to silence dissent has not lessened and those speaking up continue to be rounded up and detained.\n\nHuang Qi, a dissident released this month from prison and interviewed by telephone, said, \"We closely follow dozens of rights' defense cases, and I've found that that at the grassroots and lowest levels of society in China, the rights defense environment has not seen any fundamental improvements.\" He warned, \"One cannot count how many ordinary people are being locked up or taken away every day.\"\n\nHowever, Wan Yanhau who is a Chinese activist living in the US said there might be a short term diminishing of the crackdowns on human rights activists. He suggested the government could be realizing that the harsh treatment of dissidents has not stopped recent episodes of unrest. The riots by migrant workers in the Guangdong province and protests by ethnic Mongolians are recent examples. Further, China is receiving harsh criticism from European countries with which it wants to increase trade.\n\nBut illegal detentions are increasing, according to Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch, and are signs that China is not moving toward compliance with international norms.",

The picture was recorded last September by a camera trap placed by the Vietnamese government and the WWF.\n\nThe saola, an antelope-like animal with long horns, had not been seen in Vietnam since 1998, said Quảng Nam Forest Protection Department Deputy Head Dang Dinh Nguyen. The saola is critically endangered, according to the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. The WWF estimates only a few dozen saola, or at most a few hundred, survive in remote, dense upland forests along Vietnam's border with Laos. They have never survived in captivity.\n\nThe WWF hopes to help save the saola from extinction by safeguarding its habitat from poachers.

    "original_text": "American comedian and Daily Show anchor Jon Stewart has been chosen to host the 78th Annual Academy Awards. This is not Stewart's first time hosting an awards show as he hosted the Grammys in 2001 and 2002.\n\nHis choice by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences shows their continuing attempt to target a younger viewing audience. Last year's host was Chris Rock, also a comedian who is popular with young adults, whose performance and jokes at the expense of celebrities irked some Academy members. The Academy has also been seeking an Oscar host with the appeal of popular hosts such as Billy Crystal, Johnny Carson, and Bob Hope.\n\nThe choice further demonstrates Stewart's transformation from the host of a cult TV show into a mainstream performer. Stewart is host of The Daily Show, a satirical show aired on Comedy Central that parodies network and cable news shows. The show started in 1996, anchored by Stewart's predecessor Craig Kilborn, who left in 1999 to host The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn. The Daily Show draws in about 1.4 million viewers nightly. While not a groundbreaking number, sixty-five percent of those viewers are in the 18 to 49 age group, which is the group most coveted by television advertisers.\n\nThe Daily Show has become influental in politics and pop culture. Stewart has interviewed many guests from both sides of the political spectrum, including 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry, Bill O'Reilly, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and has asked for President George W. Bush to come on the show, going so far as publish an invitation in a full page newspaper ad during the 2004 Republican National Convention.\n\nStewart has interviewed celebrities like Bruce Willis, Ice Cube, The Rock, and recently interviewed the band The White Stripes who then did a live studio performance.\n\nAlthough The Daily Show is steeped in satire, its emphasis on political coverage and current events has led to many of its younger viewers regard it as their daily news source, especially during the 2004 presidential election. Stewart was even considered as a possible replacement for Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News by CBS executive Leslie Moonves, which owned Comedy Central before splitting into two companies just a few days ago.\n\nAlthough a comedian, Stewart can be serious at times. Notable was his appearance on the CNN show Crossfire in which he got into a debate with host Tucker Carlson over the state of television journalism. He accused Crossfire of polarizing politics and that it was hurting America, saying \"It's not so much that it's bad, as it's hurting America ... Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America.\" He referred to Carlson and co-host Paul Begala as \"partisan hacks\", and said that Carlson was \"as big a dick on his show as he is on any show\". Many believe this highly publicized criticizm led to the cancellation of Crossfire.\n\nThe Daily Show has won seven Emmys and a Peabody Award for their coverage of the 2000 presidential election.\n\nThe Academy Awards ceremony will be held on ABC this year on March 5th.",

    "original_text": "The new MacBook Air\nIn a Wednesday media event, Apple Inc. released a new lineup of MacBook Air laptops and the 2011 version of the company's iLife software suite. The \"Back to the Mac\" event also included a preview of Apple's forthcoming Mac OS X Lion operating system, to be released in mid-2011.\n\nApple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the new products at the Cupertino, California event, saying the company has \"been inspired by the work it has done on the iPad, and it wants to bring it back to the Mac.\" Apple has plans to import more features of its iOS mobile operating system to the Mac OS X operating system.\n\nJobs announced today that the \"Lion\" release to OS X, which is scheduled for release next summer, will include more support for multitouch and a desktop version of the company's App Store. He said that the App Store will be available for Apple's current OS \"Snow Leopard\" within 90 days, and that applications can be submitted starting next month. Jobs also announced that a beta version of FaceTime, Apple's IOS video calling application, would be available for OS X users immediately. Several new applications will be added in OS X Lion, dubbed \"Mission Control\" and \"Launchpad.\"\n\nsource= Steve Jobs\n\nIn his keynote address Wednesday, Jobs announced the release of Apple's iLife '11 software suite, which includes the iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand programs. iPhoto has new slide show templates, while iMovie has added audio editing capabilities. GarageBand now includes several new piano- and guitar-playing lessons. iLife '11 was released on Wednesday as a US$49 upgrade, and is also available free with new Mac purchases.\n\nIn another move to bring iOS functionality to Macintosh computers, Jobs announced an updated MacBook Air series of laptops, on sale now. The new MacBook Air uses flash memory rather than a traditional hard drive, and has no CD/DVD drive, an approach seen on the iPad tablet computer. In addition, the laptop's battery life has been extended, even though it is only 0.68 in (1.73 cm) thick and weighs less than 3 lbs (1.36 kg). \"We think it’s the future of notebooks,\" said Jobs. There are now two models of the MacBook Air: an 11.6-inch (29.46-cm) version and a 13.3-inch (33.78-cm) model. Analyst Shawn Wu says the company \"priced it really aggressively,\" referring to the computer's base price of US$999.\n\nJobs said that his company sold 13.7 million Macs last year, totaling US$22 billion. In the last financial quarter, Mac sales increased 22 percent, comprising 24 percent of total revenue for Apple. However, the original MacBook Air did not fare so well. Sales and hype over the first Air decreased soon after its introduction, and the line was overshadowed by the release of Apple's 13-inch (33.02-cm) MacBook Pro. The MacBook Air had not been significantly updated since 2008.",

This trial would make Jetstar one of the first airlines in the world to offer the iPad.\n\nStarting later this month, Jetstar plans to begin a two-week trial, during which passengers will have the option to rent iPads for AU$10 on domestic flights longer than an hour. Thirty iPads would be available on each test plane. These devices would be preloaded with games, e-books, music and video content. Internet access however will be disabled as per Jetstar's policy on internet connected devices, said spokeswoman Andrea Wait.\n\nThe iPads offered by Jetstar, will be specially customized by Bluebox Avionics. Bluebox Avionics, at present, is the only company to offer iPads as part of an in-flight entertainment system. Jetstar will be the first to offer the Bluebox Avionics iPad based systems, though, Bluebox Avionics has said the system will be available to other airlines soon.\n\nShortly following the initial release of the iPad, Jetstar chief information officer Stephen Tame speculated that the iPad \"may lead in the future the end of airline in-flight entertainment systems\". Depending on the results of the trial, iPads may replace existing Jetstar in-flight entertainment systems.\n\nJetstar chief executive Bruce Buchanan said he expected the iPads to be very popular during the trial. If the trial is successful, the airline would “be looking to roll out the devices across our entire domestic and international network later in the year\", said Buchanan.",

It is the first rocky planet to be discovered orbiting a star, although three other rocky planets have in the past been discovered in orbit around a pulsar. There are two other gaseous, Jupiter-like planets in orbit around the same star.\n\n\"This is the smallest extrasolar planet yet detected and the first of a new class of rocky terrestrial planets,\" said Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution, one of the teams that discovered the new planet. \"It's like Earth's bigger cousin.\"\n\nThe newly discovered world has about 7½ times the mass of Earth. Its orbital period, or \"year\", is a mere 2 days in length and its path takes it 10 times closer to its star than the closest planet is to our Sun. The temperature on the surface is estimated between 400 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit (200 to 400 degrees Celsius), and is too hot for life forms that are similar to those found on Earth.\n\n\"A planet seven and a half times the mass of the Earth could easily hold onto an atmosphere,\" explained Gregory Laughlin, an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of California in Santa Cruz. \"It would still be considered a rocky planet, probably with an iron core and a silicate mantle. It could even have a dense steamy water layer. I think what we are seeing here is something that's intermediate between a true terrestrial planet like the Earth and a hot version of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.\"\n\nAstronomers are continuing to advance the science of detecting extrasolar worlds. \"We are pushing a whole new regime at Keck Observatory in Hawaii to achieve one meter per second precision, triple our old precision, that should also allow us to see Earth-mass planets around sun-like stars within the next few years,\" Butler said.\n\n* NSF Press Release: Astronomers Announce the Most Earth-Like Planet Yet Found Outside the Solar System",

The flyer is a caricature of a devil with small signs declaring that Sweden is a \"Homo-fascist state\" and a \"damned land of ...

Other than the Asian Tsunami disaster, the group has, in the past, declared the September 11th attacks on the United States and the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster are messages from God warning of His wrath to come against homosexuals, whom he refers to as 'fags' on account of the fact that, like a faggot of wood, they \"fuel God's wrath\".\n\nIn the FAQ of their main website, GodHatesFags.com, Rev. Phelps expresses his followers' opinions of the Tsunami disaster:\n\n\"The tsunami was an adumbration of the wrath of God, a harbinger of things to come: that Great Day of Judgment... those Asian countries weren’t the only ones affected by the tsunami. Do you realize that among the dead and missing are 3,500 Swedes and over 3,000 Americans?

Between 20 and 30 people were arrested in the Paris region following an investigation into the funding of Islamist extremists. Police described Monday's events as a \"major operation aimed at disbanding an Islamist network linked to terrorism\".\n\nAmong those arrested in a string of dawn raids were individuals linked to previous terrorism investigations and common crime, the police statement said. Those detained remained in custody and police were searching a number of premises and Internet cafes. The suspects were under surveillance for several weeks and were detained after evidence emerged that \"violent actions\" were being planned.\n\nThose arrested are suspected of staging armed robberies to finance radical Islamist causes. French investigators were reportedly \"convinced\" those arrested intended to stage violent acts on French territory, a French radio station reported.\n\nSome 20 suspects were arrested before dawn in five different regions. Others were arrested several hours later around suburban Paris. The raids were carried out by the domestic intelligence service, DST, detectives from France's organised crime unit and members of the RAID crack intervention squad.\n\nFrance has been on red alert, the second highest security level, since the suicide bomb attacks on London transport on July 7.",

    "original_text": "On Halloween night, October 31, during a 2-hour long live episode of NBC show Phenomenon, famed magician Criss Angel told Uri Geller and Jim Callahan, \"I will give you a million dollars of my personal money right now if either one of you can tell me specific details of what’s in this envelope right now.\" While Geller ignored Angel's challenge, Callahan started to confront Angel in a hostile manner, as host Tim Vincent held him back and Geller held Angel back.\n\nPreviously Angel made it clear that he will not \"tolerate\" fellow magicians who try to pass their illusions off as paranormal. For example, on the day before the Halloween special, Angel told Larry King, \"No one has the ability, that I'm aware of, to do anything supernatural, psychic, talk to the dead. And that was what I said I was going to do with Phenomenon. If somebody goes on that show and claims to have supernatural psychic ability, I'm going to bust them live and on television.\"\n\nIn the midst of the confrontation, the TV show cut to a commercial break. Vincent said the show was not \"Jerry Springer.\" When the last contestant appeared Angel said it was \"a hell of a lot more entertaining than the previous act.\" The following week Callahan was voted off the show by the TV audience.\n\nJames Randi, a former magician who had previously worked with Angel and a long standing critic of Geller and psychics, wrote of the incident, \"Criss Angel said, in his rather lengthy comments, 'Callahan demonstrated something that is unexplainable to some' — though to whom that might have applied, I cannot fathom — and Criss is beginning to sound very much like that chap James Randi, tossing about a million-dollar challenge.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that Uri Geller has been challenged by a professional magician. Thirty years ago, during a French television show called Droit de réponse, Gerard Majax demonstred that all \"so called\" powers shown previously during the show by Geller could be reproduced by a magician even more convincingly than Geller.",

The decline is worse than the average 4.7% drop forecast by economists.\n\n“We are likely to emerge from this recession very slowly and the recovery will be very weak. The aggressive policy response we have gotten will take time to work, but it will counter the still-strong headwinds holding the economy back,” said the chief economist at Morgan Stanley in New York, Richard Berner.\n\nStock market shares went up on Wednesday, following an analyst's report suggesting that non-performing assets will reach their height in 2009. As of noon, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index had gained 2.2%, reaching a level of 873,59 points.",

It organizes the Special Olympics World Games which is recognized by the International Olympic Committee and is similar to the Paralympic Games which are for people with physical disabilities.\n\nEven before the taped show was aired, Barack Obama called the chairman of the Special Olympics to apologize. He phoned Timothy Shriver from Air Force One on the way back to Washington, D.C.. Tim Shriver is also the son of Eunice Kennedy Shriver who founded the Special Olympics.\n\n\"He expressed his disappointment, and he apologized in a way that was very moving. He expressed that he did not intend to humiliate this population,\" Shriver said on Friday in an interview on Good Morning America.\n\n\"Words hurt, words do matter,\" Shriver added. \"People with special needs are great athletes and productive citizens.\"\n\n\"The President made an offhand remark making fun of his own bowling that was in no way intended to disparage the Special Olympics,\" White House deputy press secretary, Bill Burton, said. \"He thinks that the Special Olympics are a wonderful program that gives an opportunity to shine to people with disabilities from around the world.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kolan McConiughey, a top Special Olympics bowler told the Associated Press that he doesn't think Obama bowls like a Special Olympian.\n\n\"He bowled a 129. I bowl a 300. I could beat that score easily,\" McConiughey said. McConiughey has five perfect 300 games on his track record as a bowler and averages a score of 212.\n\n\"I'd tell him to get a new bowling ball, new shoes and bring him down to the lane,\" said McConiughey, offering bowling advice to the President. \"Keep his body straight, his arm straight and keep his steps straight. He has to practice every single day.\"\n\nMaria Shriver, sister of Tim Shriver, said the President's comment \"hurts millions of people throughout the world.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is married to Maria Shriver, said, \"He Obama loves Special Olympics, and he would do everything he can to help Special Olympics.\"\n\nPress Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters, \"I know that the President believes that the Special Olympics are a triumph of the human spirit, and I think he understands that they deserve a lot better than — than the thoughtless joke that he made last night. And he apologizes for that.\"",

    "original_text": "Liberia\nFormer President of Liberia Charles Taylor was today found guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes by the Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague, Netherlands. Taylor was acquitted of actually ordering the offences or being part of a joint enterprise to conduct them.\n\nThe eleven-count indictment produced a four-year trial that heard allegations of rape, murder, sexual slavery, cannibalism, arms dealing, \"blood\" diamond trade, and use of child soldiers. Prosecution witnesses totalled 94 whilst the defence had 21 including the accused. Taylor spent his seven months of evidence claiming he was a peacemaker.\n\nThe allegations date to civil war in Sierra Leone, which ran from 1991 to 2002. Taylor, who had been a warlord since the '80s, backed the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF). Taylor was elected Liberian president in 1997 after a different civil war concluded.\n\nSix years later he was ousted when an arrest warrant was issued and fled to Nigeria. He was arrested there in 2006 whilst again trying to flee. Taylor, who had been facing a rebellion against him since 1999 in Liberia, had received training from Libyan ruler Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime.\n\nTestimony included claims that Taylor-backed fighters adorned roads with human intestines and ate human flesh. One claimed to have seen Taylor himself eat human liver, something Taylor denied. One described asking RUF rebels to sever his only hand in exchange for his young son's life.\n\nFurther allegations said teenage children were involved in the fighting and that Taylor sold illegally mined diamonds to finance arms purchases for the RUF. Western celebrities Naomi Campbell, a model, and Mia Farrow, an actress, described an incident at a charity dinner held by Nelson Mandella, then South Africa's head, in 1997. Campbell and Farrow said Taylor gifted Campbell a number of diamonds. Taylor is claimed to have ordered seizure of Sierra Leone's diamond deposits by RUF soldiers.\n\nIt was claimed in court that child soldiers were used in conflict, as diamond mine guards, and to carry out amputations. Allegations of forced amputation were made.\n\nThe court, which has spent a year considering its verdicts, unanimously found Taylor guilty. It ruled Taylor knew at least from 1997 the full extent of RUF activities in Sierra Leone, and that he helped bankroll activities dealing in blood diamonds. A judge said more than a thousand youngsters had 'RUF' carved into their skin to prevent escape. From the moment he receives the full judgement Taylor has two weeks in which to file an appeal.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International welcomed the verdict, which is the first conviction of a head of state before an international court since the Nuremburg trials prosecuted Nazi leaders after World War Two. Karl Dönitz was convicted after he took brief control of Germany in the aftermath of Adolf Hitler's suicide.\n\nFormer President of Yugoslavia Slobodan Milosevic faced trial but died before a judgement was handed down. Laurent Gbagbo, once Presldent of the Ivory Coast, is in custody at The Hague awaiting trial before the International Criminal Court. Taylor joins eight other Special Court convicts, all of whom are from Sierra Leone. He is the first African ruler to appear in The Hague.\n\nThe Special Court was formed jointly by Sierra Leone's present administration and the United Nations.\n\nThe Netherlands agreed the process could be held there on the condition Taylor did not serve sentence there if convicted. He is expected to be sent to the UK, where Foreign Office has promised to uphold an agreement to imprison him there made by ex-Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett.",

    "original_text": "ScientologyThe Florida newspaper St. Petersburg Times published a series of investigative articles on Scientology on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, including exclusive interviews with former high-ranking executives within the organization. Four former Scientology executives stated that they witnessed the Church of Scientology's leader David Miscavige physically strike staff members numerous times.\n\nThe former executives speaking out include Mike Rinder, who served as head of the organization's legal and public relations division the Office of Special Affairs, Mark Rathbun, former Inspector General of the organization's Religious Technology Center, Tom De Vocht, former manager of the organization's operations in Clearwater, Florida, and Amy Scobee, a former Scientology staff member in California who assisted in construction of Scientology's Celebrity Centres. Rathbun supervised the Church of Scientology's response to the Lisa McPherson case, after she died under Scientology care in 1995.\n\n4=Mark Rathbun, former Inspector General of Scientology's Religious Technology Center\nRinder said the impact was more one of humiliation than physical pain: \"The issue wasn't the physical pain of it (being assaulted by Miscavige). The issue was the humiliation and the domination. ... It's the fact that the domination you're getting — hit in the face, kicked — and you can't do anything about it.\" Rathbun asserted Miscavige would assault executives during conferences. \"Regularly David Miscavige would in the middle of a conference physically assault, punch, slap or grab by the neck a number of executives,\" said Rathbun.\n\nDe Vocht said that Miscavige would \"lose it\" if he did not hear a satisfactory answer from his executives: \"If it wasn't the answer he wanted to hear, he'd lose it. If it was contrary to how he thought, he'd lose it. If he found it to be smart aleck, or it was a better answer than he had, he would lose it.\" Scobee was critical of Miscavige's actions while calling himself a \"religious leader\". \"You cannot call yourself a religious leader as you beat people, as you confine people, as you rip apart families. If I was trying to destroy Scientology, I would leave David Miscavige right where he is because he's doing a fantastic job of it,\" she said.\n\nIn its preparation for the investigation, The St. Petersburg Times staff met with attorneys and representatives for the Church of Scientology for 25 hours. According to the paper Miscavige was sought out by reporters for an interview from May 13, but they were informed he would not be available prior to July. Miscavige e-mailed the paper on Saturday, complaining that he was not interviewed. \"I am at a loss to comprehend how the St. Petersburg Times can publish a story about me and the religion I lead without accepting the offer to speak with me,\" wrote Miscavige.\n\nChurch of Scientology representatives denied the statements made by their former executives, and claimed the individuals left the organization after being demoted. They claimed the former executives were motivated by feelings of revenge and only speaking to the press for financial gain.\n\n4=Scientology representative Lyman Spurlock\nScientology spokesman Tommy Davis acknowledged violence occurred within the ranks of Scientology management, but claimed that it was Rathbun and not Miscavige who carried out the assaults. In comments to the Associated Press, Davis referred to the statements made by former executives about Miscavige as \"absolutely, unquestionably false\". Scientology representative Lyman Spurlock stated \"What they want to do is extort money from the church. ... and right now the St. Pete Times is their extortion vehicle... you're just their lackeys. They're using you.\"\n\nWhat do you think of the statements made by the former Scientology executives?\nThe St. Petersburg Times reported Monday on the attention received by the investigative articles in other media. The Associated Press carried the story, and it was included in over 177 television and news websites including MSNBC, the Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and the Chicago Sun-Times, as well as blogs and media sites for The Huffington Post, Gawker, L.A. Weekly, and The Village Voice. By Monday the first article in the series had received over 3,600 \"diggs\" at the social news website Digg and generated over 420 comments at the site. A post at the \"On Deadline\" blog of USA Today called the investigation \"a fascinating three-part series\". \"Juicy stuff from a mainstream newspaper coming out and hitting Scientology hard,\" said biologist and University of Minnesota, Morris associate professor PZ Myers in a post to his blog Pharyngula. \"I'm sure there are meetings going on in Clearwater right now where they're plotting revenge,\" wrote Myers.",

A group of people has launched a campaign to collect money via the Internet to acquire a former British sea platform situated in the North Sea, six miles (9.6 kilometers) off the British coast.\n\nThe Pirate Bay states that the platform, named Sealand, will give users an easy way of sharing files protected by copyright in other nations. According to the statement made on the website, those who invest in purchasing Sealand will receive citizenship in it.\n\nThe platform was occupied in 1967 by the associates and family members of Paddy Roy Bates, a former radio broadcaster and former British Army Major, who now form its royal family. Prince Roy and Princess Joan Bates and their son Prince Regent Michael are willing to sell the platform for £65m. The royal family claims that it is independent and outside of any country's jurisdiction.\n\nThe sovereign status of the platform is disputed. The Government of the United Kingdom extended the territorial waters from 3 to 12 nautical miles after 1987, placing Sealand in its jurisdiction. However, Prince Roy simultaneously expanded the territory of Sealand and claimed continued independence. (See Sealand on Wikipedia.)\n\nHired estate agents from Spain estimate the price of the floating island to be about 504 million pounds. The Swedish website mentioned that it was looking for alternatives to acquire Sealand. It also mentioned that if the \"Internet-pirate\" community is not able to buy Sealand, it will look for another small place to claim as its own.\n\nThe Pirate Bay website was closed for some time in May 2006 due to Swedish police raids. The site was later re-opened from the Netherlands before moving back to Sweden.",

It was posted on his blog along with a reply that mocked Kluger and brought ridicule and criticism against Adam Kugler and his agency. According to Crouse, Kluger emailed him once again to claim it had been an automated email, and later requested that Crouse remove the post and comments criticizing himself and his agency, threatening a $150,000 lawsuit against Crouse for defamation.\n\nIs the use of product placement in popular music degrading to the artists?Kluger Agency is known for advertising brands like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, Mercedes-Benz, and Nike by inserting the brand names in the songs of popular artists like Mariah Carey, Black Eyed Peas, Fall Out Boy, Pink, Lady GaGa and Ludacris. Kluger, founded in 2006, represents over 170 corporations and focuses on well-known record labels.\n\nKluger and his PR team have come forward defending the advertising techniques, stating that they do not have songs made just for the products in question and do not infringe on artistic integrity. \"Now, we don't want an artist to write a song specifically to promote a brand, we just feel that if it's a product that's admired by the artist and fits his/her image, we now have the capability of leveling out the playing field and making things financially beneficial for all parties involved,\" he was quoted saying to Wired.\n\nHowever, the agency's website shows video examples of its product placement, with brand images and names often being repeated, pointed at, praised, or being the basis of the song. The website also advertises that \"a successful 'brand-dropping' campaign will imprint the brand name and product into your market's subconscious\".",

At least 28 people were injured in the bombing. The bus was transporting passengers on the Dan Number 142 line. Authorities are still investigating the bombing. Israeli police said they don't know if the bomb was left on the bus by a departing passenger or thrown by someone outside.\n\n\"Person who planted bomb in Tel Aviv bus yesterday-found and arrested. He is an Arab-Israeli from Taybe &amp; was a member of Hamas\", said Avital Leibovich, a spokesperson for the IDF, in a statement posted to her Twitter account.\n\nMost of the suspects were from the Israeli town of Beit Lahia. One was a Palestinian with Israeli citizenship. The suspects were allegedly part of the Islamic Jihad and Hamas. Reports say most have admitted to their involvement in the bombing. Earlier reports, attributed to Israeli intelligence officials, suggested the bombing was the \"act of a lone operator\" and that the individual had no ties to a terrorist organization.\n\nAccording to the driver of the bus, Nachum Herzi, no passengers prior to the explosion seemed suspicious. Herzi recalled there were not many people on the bus and said \"I felt the explosion ... smoke was everywhere, you couldn't see a thing.\" After the explosion Herzi said he drove the bus for a few more meters until he was able to pull over and help passengers.\n\nAlthough no group claimed responsibility for the bombing, Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for Hamas, \"blessed\" to the bombing when saying, \"We see it as a natural response to the Israeli massacres...in Gaza. Palestinian factions will resort to all means in order to protect our Palestinian civilians in the absence of a world effort to stop the Israeli aggression.\"\n\nThis is the first such bombing to occur in Tel Aviv since April 2006 when a suicide bomber blew himself up at a restaurant near the bus station in the center of the city. Eleven people were killed and 68 were injured. In that attack, Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility. The suicide bombing was the first since Hamas took over the government of Palestine a few weeks earlier.",

    "original_text": "Iraq\nTony Blair, former prime minister of the United Kingdom, appeared before the Iraq Inquiry today. He faced six hours of questioning, starting at 6:30 am, at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London concerning his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion. During the inquiry, Blair stood by his decision to invade, saying he would make the same decision again.\n\nThis is the third time Blair has given evidence at an inquiry into the Iraq War, having already testified before the Hutton Inquiry and the Butler Review, as well as participating in an investigation by the Intelligence and Security Committee. The Hutton Inquiry found that the government did not \"sex up\" the dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The Butler Review uncovered \"serious flaws\" in pre-war intelligence, and this inquiry was set up by current prime minister Gordon Brown in order to \"learn the lessons\" of the war. Sir John Chilcott, the inquiry chairman, began by stressing that Blair was not \"on trial\", but could be called back to give further evidence if necessary.\n\nAt the end of the session, Chilcott asked Blair if he had any regrets, to which Blair replied that he was \"sorry\" that it was \"divisive\", but said that invading was the right thing to do since he believes \"the world is a safer place as a result.\" Blair said that the inquiry should ask the \"2010 question\", which refers to the hypothetical position that the world would be in if Saddam Hussein were not removed from power. He said that \"today we would have a situation where Iraq was competing with Iran ... in respect of support of terrorist groups\".\n\nAt the inquiry, the topics on which Blair was questioned included his reasons for invading Iraq.\n\nAt the time, he said that his reasons were based on a need to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction; however, interviews held later suggest that removing Saddam Hussein from power was his primary objective. Blair denies this, asserting that the need to dispose of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was the only reason for the United Kingdom's participation in the invasion. He explained that, in an interview with Fern Britton, he \"did not use the words regime change\", and, what he was trying to say was, \"you would not describe the nature of the threat in the same way if you knew then what you knew now, that the intelligence on WMD had been shown to be wrong\".\n\nHe said, despite no weapons of mass destruction being found by UN weapons inspectors, he still believes that Saddam Hussein had the means to develop and deploy them; \"he had used them, he definitely had them ... and so in a sense it would have required quite strong evidence the other way to be doubting the fact that he had this programme ... The primary consideration for me was to send an absolutely powerful, clear and unremitting message that after September 11 if you were a regime engaged in WMD weapons of mass destruction, you had to stop.\"\n\nFAHe also said that weapons of mass destruction and regime change were not separate issues, but \"conjoined\", since \"brutal and oppressive\" regimes with such weapons are a \"bigger threat\" than less hostile nations with the same weapons. He said that Hussein's regime was hiding important information from UN weapons inspectors, and had \"no intention\" of complying with them. He asserted that he has \"no regrets\" about removing Hussein, \"a monster and I believe he threatened not just the region but the world.\"\n\nThere were also questions about why the UN weapons inspectors were not given more time in Iraq in March 2003. Blair responded by saying that it would have made very little difference, as Iraq had the knowledge and \"intent\" to rebuild its weapons program from scratch if it were dismantled. He was also asked whether he still believed that the war was morally justified. He said that he did. He also said that the war was required because more diplomatic solutions had already failed, and the \"containment\" of Hussein's regime through diplomatic sanctions was \"eroding\" when the decision to invade was made.\nsource=Tony Blair\nHe also said that attitudes towards Saddam Hussein and the threat he presented \"changed dramatically\" after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York. He said, \"I never regarded 11 September as an attack on America, I regarded it as an attack on us.\" He said that he believed terrorists would use biological and chemical weaponry, and also said, \"if those people inspired by this religious fanaticism could have killed 30,000 they would have. My view was you could not take risks with this issue at all.\"\n\nHe later said, \"When I talked earlier about the calculus of risk changing after September 11 it's really important I think to understand in so far as to understanding the decision I took, and frankly would take again. If there was any possibility that he could develop weapons of mass destruction we should stop him. That was my view then. It's my view now.\"\n\nHe was also asked about his supposed commitment to George W. Bush that United Kingdom would join the United States in an Iraq war, which he is said to have made at Bush's Crawford ranch in 2002. Blair stubbornly denied that this took place, saying that what was said is that Saddam Hussein had to be \"dealt with\", and that \"the method of doing that is open\". Instead, he says, his reasons for the invasion were moral.\nsource=Tony Blair\nHe also said, \"This isn't about a lie or a conspiracy or a deceit or a deception. It's a decision. And the decision I had to take was, given Saddam's history, given his use of chemical weapons, given the over one million people whose deaths he had caused, given 10 years of breaking UN resolutions, could we take the risk of this man reconstituting his weapons programmes or is that a risk that it would be irresponsible to take?\"\n\nHe said of Bush: \"I think what he took from that the meeting was exactly what he should have taken, which was if it came to military action because there was no way of dealing with this diplomatically, we would be with him.\" He did admit, however, that—a year later, as the invasion approached—he had been offered a \"way out\" of the war, which he declined. He said of this, \"I think President Bush at one point said, before the House of Commons debate, 'Look if it's too difficult for Britain, we understand'. I took the view very strongly then—and do now—that it was right for us to be with America, since we believed in this too.\"\n\nAnother line of questioning focused on his 45-minute claim, which was included in the September 2002 dossier but redacted after the war. It states that Hussein was able to deploy nuclear weapons within 45 minutes of giving the order. This dossier also contained the words, \"the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons\". However, the inquiry has revealed that there were certain caveats involved, so the claim was not—anti-war campaigners claim—\"beyond doubt\", especially since senior civil servants have told the inquiry that intelligence suggested that Hussein's weapons of mass destruction had been dismantled.\n\nBlair said that it \"would have been better if (newspaper) headlines about the '45-minute claim' had been corrected\" to state—as he admits he should have made clear—that the claim referred to battlefield munitions, rather than to missiles. He says that, with the benefit of hindsight, he would have liked to have published the intelligence reports themselves, since they were \"absolutely strong enough\". He did insist, however, that the intelligence that was available at the time put it \"beyond doubt\" that Iraq was continuing to develop weaponry. He added that \"things obviously look quite different\" after the war, since weapons of mass destruction were not found.\n\nOne of the main topics was the legality of the war. Earlier this week, a senior Foreign Office legal advisor claimed that the war would be illegal without a further United Nations Security Council resolution—which was not obtained. The attorney general at the time, Lord Peter Goldsmith, said that the cabinet refused to enter into a debate over the legality of the war, and that Blair had not received his advice that a further UN resolution would be needed warmly. He insists that he \"desperately\" tried to find a diplomatic solution to the problem until France and Russia \"changed their position\" and would not allow the passage of a further resolution.\n\nBlair also said that he would not have invaded had Goldsmith said that it \"could not be justified legally\", and explained Goldsmith's change of mind by saying that the then attorney general \"had to come to a conclusion\", and his conclusion was that the war was legal. He did not know why Goldsmith made this conclusion, but said he believes that it may be due to the fact that weapons inspectors \"indicated that Saddam Hussein had not taken a final opportunity to comply\" with the UN.\n\nQuestions were also asked on the government's poor post-war planning, and claimed confusion about whether the US had a plan for Iraq after the war was over. Blair was drilled about the lack of priority that was given to the issue of post-war planning. He was also asked about the lack of equipment that British soldiers were given. This line of questioning was pursued in front of the families of some of the soldiers who died in Iraq—many of whom blame the poor equipment for the deaths of their relatives.\n\nShould Tony Blair be considered a war criminal?\nThe families of some of the 179 British soldiers killed in the Iraq war, along with around 200 anti-war protesters, held a demonstration calling for Blair to be declared a war criminal outside the centre in London's City of Westminster. They chanted \"Tony Blair, war criminal\" as the former prime minister gave evidence inside. Blair was jeered by a member of the audience as he made his closing statement, and the families booed him, chanting \"you are a liar\" and \"you are a murderer\" as he left the centre.\n\nIn order to avoid the protesters, he arrived early and was escorted by security as he entered through the back door, with large numbers of police officers standing by. One of these protesters, Iraqi Saba Jaiwad, said, \"The Iraqi people are having to live every day with aggression, division, and atrocities. Blair should not be here giving his excuses for the illegal war, he should be taken to The Hague to face criminal charges because he has committed crimes against the Iraqi people.\"\n\nAhmed Rushdi, an Iraqi journalist, said that he was unsurprised by Blair's defence of the invasion, because, \"A liar is still a liar\". He also claimed that the war had done more harm than good, because, \"Before 2003 there were problems with security, infrastructure and services, and people died because of the sanctions, but after 2003 there are major disasters. Major blasts have killed about 2,000 people up till now. After six years or seven years there is no success on the ground, in any aspect.\"\n\nsource=Nick Clegg\nCurrent prime minister Gordon Brown, who set up the inquiry, said before Blair's appearance that it was not a cause for concern. Anthony Seldon, Blair's biographer, called the session \"a pivotal day for him Blair, for the British public and for Britain's moral authority in the world\". Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who opposes the war, said in Friday's Daily Telegraph that it was \"a pivotal moment in answering a question millions of British people are still asking themselves: Why did we participate in an illegal invasion of another country?\" He called the invasion \"subservience-by-default to the White House\", and questioned the \"special relationship\" between between the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nVincent Moss, the political editor of the Sunday Mirror newspaper, criticised the inquiry for being too soft on Blair. He said, \"A lot of ground wasn't covered, and in my mind it wasn't covered in enough detail, particularly the dodgy dossier in September 2002. There wasn't very much interrogation on that, they pretty much accepted what Tony Blair said about the intelligence. We could have had an awful lot stronger questioning on that\".\n\nIt is feared by some senior Labour Party politicians that today's events could ignite strong feelings about the issue in voters, and thereby damage the popularity of the party, which is already trailing behind the Conservative Party with a general election required in the first half of the year.",

    "original_text": "align=right\n\nIn a \"fireside chat\" at Yale University on Wednesday, prominent naturalists Edward O. Wilson and Peter H. Raven predicted dire consequences for the planet's biodiversity and habitability unless current trends in consumption and environmental degradation are reversed. The two scientists were awarded the Addison Emery Verrill Medal by the Peabody Museum of Natural History for their contributions to natural science before a capacity crowd at Yale's Sprague Hall. Both are known for their environmental activism as well as extensive research and popular writing.\n\nWilson, known for his contributions to island biogeography as well as the controversial field of sociobiology, said that humans&amp;mdash;like all earth species&amp;mdash;are adapted to this world. But most people have the dangerous attitude that this world is \"a waystation for a better world\", warned Wilson. Humans could cause the extinction of half of all species by the end of the next century, he stated.\n\nThe event was billed as a debate between the two scientists, but they found little to disagree about. (Raven quipped that he did not care for Wilson's tie, the extent of their disagreement for the evening.) Raven pointed to unsustainably high levels of consumption, especially in the United States, that will lead to ecological disaster if left unchecked. Levels of consumption have to be cut drastically, he argued. But Wilson claimed that it would be possible to maintain and even improve quality of life even while significantly reducing the population's ecological footprint. Current models, he said, predict that human population will peak at around 9 billion, and that \"if we use what we have\" intelligently, the world could be a sustainable paradise by the 22nd century.\n\nRaven and Wilson both argued for the compatibility of Christian and environmentalist viewpoints. According to the second chapter of Genesis, said Raven, man was put on the earth in order to preserve it. Wilson said that we need to \"form an alliance\" to save life on earth&amp;mdash;an alliance including both religious and non-religious people&amp;mdash;and that one can be a \"conservative right-wing Christian\" and an environmentalist. His recent work, including the Encyclopedia of Life, has focused on creating such an alliance.\n\nThe most important thing, Raven said, is to expose children to nature. Invoking the argument of Rachel Carson's 1965 A Sense of Wonder, Raven said that children between the ages of four and ten are extremely impressionable, and that teaching them to appreciate the natural world will be the most effective way to ensure environmental consciousness in the next generation. But although Raven was a naturalist from a young age, he said that he \"didn't give a thought to conservation\" while in graduate school in the 1950s. Carson's 1962 book on the dangers of pesticides, Silent Spring, was Raven's introduction to dangers of environmental degradation. Wilson also emphasized Carson's legacy for the environmental movement; he proudly noted that Carson biographer Linda Lear had recently called him the \"only surviving person who actually helped Rachel Carson\" put together Silent Spring.\n\nRaven and Wilson were only the 16th and 17th, respectively, to receive the Verrill Medal, which is the highest honor awarded by the Peabody Museum. Before a sympathetic crowd, Wilson tactfully avoided any mention of his own institution, Yale's rival Harvard University.",

A suspected gas leak led to an explosion, followed by the ten-storey building coming down. A total of 39 are confirmed dead, officials told state media, adding that rescuers ended their work yesterday. Some reports suggest a deliberate criminal act.\n\nThe 1973 building was home to over 1,000 people; 48 apartments were damaged. Rescuers, working in temperatures well below freezing, according to the emergencies ministry recovered at least ten survivors from the debris on Monday. The building was evacuated. Over 1,000 rescuers responded.\n\nThe Investigative Committee and the Federal Security Service (FSB) said they believe gas, which leaks relatively frequently in Russia, was the trigger for the disaster which occurred at 6am as many occupants slept. President Vladimir Putin was briefed, and flew to Magnitogorsk on Monday, observing the rescue mission and visiting the wounded in hospital. In a meeting that day he was told by Emergencies Minister Yevgeny Zinichev of \"presumably between 36 and 40 people under the rubble\", while Chelyabinsk regional Deputy Governor Oleg Klimov indicated 68 people were missing.\n\nSearch and rescue was suspended on Tuesday, with Zinichev describing the \"real threat of another part of the building collapsing\" as making it \"impossible to continue working in such conditions\", and work launched to stabilise the remaining structure. He estimated this would take 24 hours. Cranes were used to hoist workers into position to demolish sections deemed dangerous. Rescue work resumed on Wednesday, with additional bodies recovered increasing the confirmed death toll from fourteen to 31.\n\n\"The search and rescue operation is complete,\" Deputy Emergency Situations Minister Alexander Chupriyan told TASS on Wednesday. Chelyabinsk's governor has promised each victim will be subject to a payout of one million rubles.\n\nHealth Minister Veronika Skvortsova indicated on Monday the chances of those trapped being found alive were already diminishing. On Tuesday an eleven-month-old boy, identified only as Ivan, was rescued alive and flown to Moscow for treatment of injuries including frostbite, leg fractures, and head trauma. He was found under rubble, still in his cot after having been trapped for over 30 hours. Ivan's condition was on Wednesday reported to not be life-threatening.\n\nThe Emergencies Ministry said six deaths were of children.\n\nOn the night of Monday to Tuesday another explosion hit a gas-powered minibus in the city. Officials said three people died; their identities were not provided. Both explosions took place on Karl Marx Avenue, within two miles of each other.\n4=Zinichev calling a temporary halt to rescue work ahead of emergency stabilisation works\nThe FSB denies the two explosions are related; reports describe speculation the disaster's cause was not in fact a gas leak. One news site, Znak.com, claims FSB sources have ascribed the explosion to terrorism. The Investigative Committee says it has found no trace of explosives despite Znak.com claiming an anonymous source described a second-floor apartment being used as an explosives depot ahead of a planned shopping centre bombing. Znak.com further reported its source said that apartment's tenant moved in the day before the blast.\n\nRegional governor Boris Dubrovsky said FSB officers were present where the minibus exploded outside the local administrative building, but said this too was unrelated to the other explosion. Znak.com reported its source said \"three terrorists\" were killed in a firefight on Monday night, while footage from the scene showed the vehicle burn amid what sounds like gunfire.\n\nThe website further reported its anonymous source claimed a fourth offender escaped and remains wanted. Monday saw armed police with dogs searching a second apartment block in Magnitigorsk. Residents there told the press the officers claimed to be seeking a bomb.",

Clashes with police in Bihar have left 20 villagers injured and one man dead, since many are staging protests after being forced from their homes. UNICEF estimates as many as 1,103 may have died in 138 districts throughout northern India.\n\nHospitals are reaching dangerous volumes as disease is sickening thousands. Many are ill from dehydration, exposure and dysentery.\n\nAid workers warn that malaria is a serious risk.\n\nThe Indian Air Force began dropping aid packages containing medical supplies and food yesterday.\n\nSantosh Mishra, a villager in the Gondra district of Uttar Pradesh remarked, \"I have not seen such flooding in the last 24 years.\" Bodies of two students of the IIM Indore swept in the flash floods in Indore were recovered.\n\nUNICEF reported that 84 people have died and some 270,000 people have been displaced by floods and landslides in 32 districts in the last two weeks. Flood waters this year have remained stationary, and are not flowing as in the past, they also said. This could lead to landslides and further damage to thousands of poorly constructed adobe homes. Thousands of acres of agricultural land have already been destroyed.\n\nClean water, is a primary concern, as much of the water has been contaminated with disease.\n\nFlooding has affected 41 of its 64 districts. The Associate Press reports that over 5 million have been displaced and that 46 have died.\n\nThe capital, Dhaka, has seen some flooding, but officials fear that soon the city will be completely inundated since torrential rains show no sign of abating.\n\nUNICEF is working with the governments of affected nations to coordinate aid, providing water purification tablets, emergency medical supplies, and various MRE's (Meals Ready to Eat). The Nepalese ministry of finance has released additional funds for continued aid work.\n\nThe conditions in the region do not seem promising, since more rain is forecast Saturday, and early next week.",

    "original_text": "South American nations began the creation of an international economic and legislative bloc by a declaration made at the Third South American Summit on 8 December. Named the South American Community of Nations, the organization is a step toward greater coordination among South American states.\n\nTwo existing South American trade blocs, the Andean Community (Comunidad Andina) and the Southern Common Market (Mercado Común del Sur, or Mercosur), have been combined and three previously uninvolved states included to create the community.\n\nThe summit, held between 7-9 December at Cusco and Ayacucho in Peru, was attended by heads of state from Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Foreign ministers attended for Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The summit was convened principally to sign the two-page Preamble to the Foundation Act of the South American Union on the second day of the summit. Although the Bolivian and Colombian presidents attended the summit, they did not attend the signing ceremony, this instead being done by representatives. Central American states Mexico and Panama attended the ceremony as observers.\n\nThe locations for the summit were chosen for their historical significance and their association with events that reflect well on South America. Cusco was the ancient capital of the advanced civilization of the Incas. Ayachucho was the site of an 1824 decisive victory against Spanish troops by the South American independence movement headed by Simón Bolívar. The First and Second South American Summits were held at Brasília, Brazil in September 2000 and Guayaquil, Ecuador in July 2002.\n\nThe community will include every state in South America with the exception of French Guiana, itself a territory of France. Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela join SACN from the Andean Community, a trade bloc established in 1969. From the more recent (1991) Mercosur comes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Guyana, Suriname, two small northeastern countries which had previously not participated in a South American trade bloc, will not immediately join the community. Chile will additionally join; it has, however, been cautious.\n\nSACN is a more ambitious union than the previous Andean Community and Mercosur. It has been established to be more than a trade union. The \"ultimate goal, which can hopefully be reached, in time, is the United States of South America,\" explains Secretary General of the Andean Community Wagner. A common currency, tariff-free common market, and regional parliament are all proposed in the Cusco declaration.\n\nMany disputes exist between South American nations that may be issues in advancing SACN.\n\nThe principal force behind SACN has been Brazil. The First South American Summit was held in Brazil through the efforts of Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.\n\nChile has been an associate member of Mercosur since 1996. It was a member of the Andean Community from its inception in 1969, but withdrew six years later when ruled by General Augusto Pinochet. With 70% of its GDP attributed to foreign trade, Chile has traditionally favored relations with the United States or the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum over South American agreements.\n\nSACN's short-term political and economic effects may be limited. The elimination of all trade tariffs has long been a goal of both the Andean Community and Mercosur, but has had little success.\n\nHowever, 32 construction projects were approved at the summit. Worth US$4.3bn over five years, the projects focus on improving regional infrastructure. The largest is a US$700m road highway that will link Brazil and Peru across the Andes mountains. \"These are anchor projects that will be carried out over five years,\" said Wagner. \"They were chosen because they do not serve merely as corridors between countries and zones, but also as a means of promoting development in border regions, which have traditionally been the poorest and most marginalised in our countries.\" Wagner identifies 350 potential infrastructure projects of a combined cost of US$200bn.\n\nDetails of the South American Community of Nations are expected to be planned further at the first First SACN Summit in March or April of 2005 in Brazil. Work on a constitution is expected to begin in 2005. A Second SACN Summit of unspecified date is to be held in Bolivia.",

It had transported passengers until 2004, when Israel Aerospace Industries converted the plane for cargo transport.

Mulally says that Ford's decision to name all their cars with the letter F was a lackluster move, and makes their names easily forgettable. As a result, Mulally plans on reviving many respected Ford nameplates, the Taurus being one of them, and the Falcon possibly in the future.\n\nThe Ford Taurus was originally introduced in 1986, and was a revolutionary car that rewrote the rules for creating a sedan, and pushed the other American automakers to follow suit, leading to a design revolution that completely rid Detroit of the \"boxy\" cars of the 70s and 80s. The Taurus survived for four generations, selling over 7,500,000 units. The Taurus was discontinued in October 2006, after a brief run of 2007 models destined for fleet customers.\n\n\"How can it go away?\" Alan Mulally remembered asking, \"It's the best-selling car in America.\"\n\nWhile it is not expected for the name change to turn the Five Hundred into a 400,000 plus units a year blockbuster like the Taurus, it is expected to make sales more solid, and to make the car well known, since the Taurus is a well known nameplate around the country.",

The Direct Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) strategy was given credit for the success.\n\nThe report added, however, that millions of people still do not have access to high quality tuberculosis care. The disease is second only to HIV/AIDS in the number of people it kills each year. About 1.8 million died of tuberculosis in 2008.\n\nDr. Mario Raviglione, director of the WHO’s Stop TB Department, is in Washington, D.C. for the release of the report. He commented that “what we are demonstrating with this new report is that on the one hand we have fairly good benefits from the investments in TB control over the last 10 to 15 years and at the same time ... we have problems that persist and are possibly getting worse.\"\n\n\"I believe that there is little commitment in many countries to expand rapidly and urgently what needs to be done for MDR-TB. Here we are dealing with a really serious urgent problem. We are talking about a half a million cases…emerging every year,” he continued.\n\nThe WHO official noted that only a small percentage, perhaps six or seven percent, of MDR-TB cases are even detected. \"Only half of them are properly treated,\" he says. “That to me is a tremendous delay and is a lack of a sense of urgency.\" Unless more is done, he predicted that there will be severe consequences.\n\n“Multi-drug resistant TB is the most serious form of tuberculosis because it does not respond to the conventional treatment that we give to patients with TB.

This meeting, which rotates locations, was also held in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Development Committee meeting ended on Sunday, with a call from the economic leaders for assistance to the countries which been adversely affected by rising food prices. Economic growth has slowed to its lowest rate in five years, while the rising costs of food and energy have not slowed.\n\nRobert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, said, \"We have to put our money where our mouth is. Now. So that we can put food into hungry mouths. It's as stark as that.\" He called for US$500 million in emergency funds for the United Nations's World Food Programme by May 1, 2008.\n\n\"All that has been done in the past decade can be undone very rapidly by the crisis coming from the increase in food prices,\" said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the IMF.\n\n\"Children will be suffering from malnutrition, with consequences for all their lives,\" he said. He cited the growing use of land for biofuels as contributing to rising food costs. In the end growing violence and civil unrest could be a result.\n\nStrauss-Kahn further warned that eventually it could become \"not only a humanitarian question,\" but could also affect developed nations by leading to trade imbalances.\n\nSpecifically cited as a current example, was Haiti, where just this weekend, violence escalated resulting in the death of a United Nations peacekeeper and the ousting of Prime Minister Jacques-Édouard Alexis.\n\nUnited States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson cautioned that affected countries \"need to resist the temptation of price controls and consumption subsidies that are generally not effective and efficient methods of protecting vulnerable groups.\"\n\n4=Robert Zoellick, World Bank president\nPrice controls and subsidies \"tend to create fiscal burdens and economic distortions while often providing aid to higher-income consumers or commercial interests other than the intended beneficiaries,\" Paulson said.\n\nIn their Friday statement, the G7 said \"there have been at times sharp fluctuations in major currencies, and we are concerned about their possible implications for economic and financial stability.\" This marked the first time since the February 2004 meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, that the wording on foreign exchange has been altered.\n\nThe G7 presented a plan to strengthen regulation of capital markets. They urged financial firms to \"fully\" disclose their at-risk investments and improve capital reserves. While the G7 did not outline new monetary or fiscal policies, it did promise action \"as appropriate.\" The timetable for the plan is 100 days.\nTullett Prebon\nThe head of G7 Market Economics at Tullett Prebon, Lena Komileva, observed, \"The implicit message is that the G7 is moving closer towards concerted action in the event that persistent volatility in the foreign exchange market presents new risk of systemic failure in the financial industry.\"\n\n\"While action is unlikely in the short run, they are probably already considering a pre-emptive move in foreign exchange markets to slow the dollar's decline,\" added Komileva.\n\nEconomists at Goldman Sachs told their clients, \"After a period where the possibility of G7 policy intervention seemed very remote, providing no counterweight to the dollar depreciation forces, we are moving towards a regime where G7 intervention is a more real possibility.\"",

    "original_text": "Initial exit polls for Thailand's general election suggest the People Power Party (PPP), allied with the former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, has a clear lead. The poll predicted the party would win 202 out of the total of 480 seats, although a survey by Suan Dusit Rajabhat University suggested the party may win as many as 256 seats.\n\nIn September 2006 a bloodless military coup overthrew Shinawatra. Following the coup, Thai Rak Thai—Thaksin's party—was disbanded amid corruption allegations. With the coup timed such that Prime Minister was in New York, he went into self-imposed exile in the UK. His supporters, who were not banned from politics, formed the People Power Party. They have benefited from Thaksin's popularity in rural areas.\n\nIf the lower prediction of 202 seats is correct it is possible that the People Power Party will not form a government. According to a Reuters report in the Washington Post the caretaker government and military leaders are likely to oppose PPP forming a coalition government.\n\nAccording to the DPA, Thaksin observed the elections from Hong Kong, instead of his London residence. The PPP have—if elected—committed to his return on February 14 next year.",

The second was in June of this year, when the Sarychev Peak volcano on the Matua Island erupted. GPS trackers on the Matua island were used to monitor the eruption, and the volcano changed its shape, adding 1.5 square kilometres of land, scientists said.\n\nGeologists also reported that the Kuril Islands nearby were slowly moving towards mainland Russia at an estimated rate of eighteen milimetres per year.",

He began playing folk and jazz music as a teenager in the 1950s but his deep voice resonated with the blues. Eric Clapton credits seeing Baldry play as an inspiration for him to play the blues himself. In the early 1960s Baldry sang with Alexis Korner's influential band, Blues Incorporated, and then went on to lead a series of bands himself and featured many new musicians who would go onto superstardom, including Rod Stewart, Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts, Jack Bruce, and Jimmy Page.\n\nHe befriended Paul McCartney while playing at the Cavern in Liverpool and performed on The Beatles' internationally televised special Around the Beatles in 1964.\n\nIn 1966, Baldry adopted Bluesology for his back-up band, after seeing \"promise\" in the young keyboard player, Reginald Dwight. In 1968, Dwight adopted the name Elton John, taking the name John in tribute to Baldry.\n\nIn 1978, he moved to the United States, spending time in New York and Los Angeles, before moving on to Vancouver permanently about 1980 and becoming a Canadian citizen.\n\nBaldry has released over 40 albums and, in the last twenty years, done much voice-over work in Canada for commercials and animations including ReBoot and narrating the Disney production, The Original Story Of Winnie-The-Pooh, which earned him a 1998 Grammy spoken word album for children nomination.\n\nBefore his illness, it had been anticipated that Baldry would be touring in the autumn in support of new recordings produced by Rod Stewart and Elton John to be released this September.",

Britain won agreement from the US Bush Administration that no British citizen would be forced to face trial by military commission, and got its citizens released from Guantanamo Bay.\n\nHicks' lawyers expect him to be granted British citizenship tonight. They will immediately request the US and British governments release him to Britain.\n\nHicks, 30, was due to be the first of nine detainees to face the US military commissions last month before a US District Court judge stopped in the proceedings. His trial is due to be held late next year. The US Government detained Hicks since 2001, after his capture in Afghanistan. He has been charged with attempted murder, conspiracy and aiding the enemy. He is believed to be the only Westerner left in Guantanamo Bay prison.",

Invincible was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 11 July 1980 and first saw service in the Falklands War in 1982. The Duke of York served aboard Invincible as a helicopter pilot.\n\nPipers played aboard Invincible while it sailed into Portsmouth Naval Base on 1 August for the last time. A gun salute and a flypast also marked the event.\n\nLast month, Invincible undertook a UK tour to celebrate the ship's silver jubilee. In June, the carrier acted as flagship for the International Fleet Review to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that Invincible would be 'mothballed' for five-years in a state of reduced readiness.\n\nIt is unlikely that Invincible will ever be recommissioned into the Royal Navy.\n\nThe MoD said that a decision to either sell, scrap or even turn Invincible into a museum ship will be made in 2010.\n\nThe decommissioning took place six-months earlier than planned and has prompted fears that the Royal Navy will be left overstretched. The move has been criticised by the opposition Conservative Party, who say that it will reduce the Royal Navy's capability at a time of \"unprecedented international tension\".\n\nArk Royal is about to undergo a major refit at Rosyth, which leaves Illustrious &amp;mdash; the Royal Navy's new Fleet Flagship &amp;mdash; as the only aircraft carrier on active service.\n\nThe three aircraft carriers are expected to be replaced by 2015 with two 65,000 tonne aircraft carriers &amp;mdash; believed to be named HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales.",

Those talks helped pave the way for Namibia's independence from South Africa.\n\nAhtisaari began his career as a school teacher before joining Finland's foreign ministry. He served as a United Nations undersecretary and secretary of state for the Finnish foreign ministry before being elected president of Finland in 1994.\n\nAhtisaari founded the Crisis Management Initiative in 2000. The Helsinki-based non-profit organization provides solutions for ending conflicts around the world.\n\nFormer United States Vice-President Al Gore won last year's Nobel peace prize along with the U.N. panel on climate change for their work on raising attention to the threat of global warming.\n\nPrior to the announcement Chinese human rights activists were high on the lists of speculations about the prospective receivers. Norwegian lawyer, author and activist, Fredrik Heffermehl published a book criticising the interpretation of the will of Nobel, just a few days prior to October 10. His interpretation is that human rights activists do not fall within the scope of the prize. Even peace mediators fall on the very edge, if the intentions of Alfred Nobel are to be taken seriously. Heffermehl points to former United States senator Sam Nunn as a long-term and 2008 nominee to the Nobel Peace Prize, that has worked much more clearly in line with the will of Nobel. Sam Nunn is an activist for disarmament of Soviets arsenals left in Russia.\n\nSome commentators of the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize, criticise the Committee, for not daring to stand up to the Chinese. The Danish peace researcher Øberg, however criticises the choice of Ahtisaari, the recipient of the prize for 2008, because of his role in the Balkans, claiming that the work of Ahtisaari added to hostilities there, instead of reducing them. Furthermore Øberg, says the Nobel Peace Committee is not comprised of experts in the relevant field, unlike the committees for the scientific prizes.",

But we do have ideas and we do have people and we've proved here in South Carolina that people power with the right ideas beats big money.\"\n\nRomney, who had been criticized by Gingrich for his business practices as CEO of Bain Capital, commented after the results were announced, \"Those who pick up the weapons of the left today will find them turned against us tomorrow...if Republican leaders want to join this president in demonizing success...then they're not going to be fit to be our nominee.\"\n\nJust a week ago, Gingrich trailed Romney by ten points in South Carolina; however, Gingrich was thought to have been successful in the two debates before the primary. During the first on Monday, he received a standing ovation for his comments on race and employment, and on Thursday, received another standing ovation after criticizing moderator John King for discussing his previous marriage. Exit polls by CBS News indicated that 65 percent of voters believed the debates were an important factor in considering a candidate, with 13 percent saying it was the most important factor.\n\nMoreover, those polls suggest Gingrich won broad support from the Tea Party and evangelicals, who questioned Romney's sincerity on social issues. They apparently decided to overlook an interview that aired just before the primary, in which Gingrich's ex-wife claimed Gingrich asked for an \"open marriage\".\n\nAccording to Furman University political science professor Brent Nelsen, Gingrich \"tapped the emotion of the right-wing electorate, and that washes away all of the questions.\"\n\nFormer Senator Rick Santorum, who, after a recent recount was found to have actually won the January 3 Iowa Caucus, finished in third place with 102,055 votes (17%). Congressman Ron Paul came in fourth with 77,993 (13%). Texas governor Rick Perry, who earlier withdrew from the race and endorsed Gingrich, finished sixth behind the withdrawn Herman Cain.\n\nHistorically, the winner of the South Carolina primary has gone on to win the Republican Party nomination; however, this is the first time three different candidates won the first three contests.\n\nThe result gives Gingrich 23 delegates, placing him first overall, ahead of Romney who has 19. Santorum is third with thirteen and Paul is fourth with three. The campaigns now shift to Florida for that state's January 31 primary. Romney currently leads in the latest polling.\n\nAccording to Republican strategist Adam Temple, \"Gingrich will carry momentum into Florida, but his campaign doesn't appear to be as durable for the long haul.\"\n\n* - Withdrew before the vote",

However, the WHO says that there is no cause for alarm at this point.\n\n\"Whenever there is a cluster, we contact Roche just to let them know that if we need to send the stockpile that they should be ready to do so,\" said a spokeswoman for the WHO, Maria Cheng. However, Cheng says \"we have not asked that anything be sent, and nothing from Roche has been sent.\"\n\nJules Pieters, director of the WHO's rapid response unit, informed Roche Holdings AG to be on alert for the next two weeks after the Indonesian health ministry informed the WHO of the deaths of the members of a family cluster in Kubu Simbelang village in North Sumatra. \"We were quite keen to inform Roche quite timely, we knew Thursday would be a holiday in Europe and wanted to make sure Roche warehouses would be open,\" he said.\n\nPieters also said that the move was part of standard procedure in cases where there is reasonable suspicion of human-to-human transmission. The WHO flew 9,500 doses of Tamiflu into Indonesia along with protective gear as a precaution.\n\nAccording to the WHO, the virus has not mutated into an easily human-transmittable form, nor had it spread outside the family, who were all blood relatives in close contact.\n\nOfficials in Indonesia also reported on Friday that two more fatal cases of avian flu were reported, this time between an 18-year-old man and his 10-year-old sister. Tests on the two victims are expected to be sent to WHO laboratories for confirmation.\n\nThe WHO also says that they have \"no intention of shipping that stockpile\" and that they consider this \"a practice run,\" said spokesman for the WHO, Dick Thompson. The WHO also said that the virus has not mutated and so far has not shown any signs of human to human transmission outside the affected family members.\n\nRoche Holding is expected to remain on high alert for at least two weeks.",

However, when enemy forces move their families into the locations where they conduct terrorist operations, they put these innocent civilians at risk.\"\n\nOne member of the missing military team has been recovered and is currently being “evaluated” on Monday, a U.S. Defence Department spokesperson said, though he refused to comment on details regarding his whereabouts and health.\n\nAfghan and U.S. forces are currently in the Kunar province searching for members of the missing military team. U.S. officials at the time of the bombing said in a statement that the attack utilised “precision-guided munitions that resulted in the deaths of an unknown number of enemy terrorists and non-combatants,\"\n\nThe statement continued, concluding that \"battle damage assessment is currently ongoing.\"\n\nIn May, Afghan president Hamid Karzai voiced his concerns over the excessive number of civilian casualties as a result of US-led operations.\n\nSome observers have speculated that the attack on the village was a deliberate response to the downing of a US transport helicopter last month.

The structure has over 3000 parking spaces; reports said more than half of those were filled. The airport was quickly closed to air traffic.\n\nIt was initially reported the fire started in an electric vehicle, but news broadcaster NRK later reported the fire started in a recalled 2005 Opel Zafira. The car was recalled after a similar fire in Cork, Ireland in August last year, causing damage to about 60 cars. Police said they questioned the car's owner.\n\nThe fire produced heavy smoke, and local officials said there was danger the building might collapse. Nils-Erik Haagenrud of Rogaland Fire and Rescue said late on Tuesday no personnel would be sent into the building. Rogaland Fire and Rescue requested support and equipment from other fire departments. The airport and nearby hotel were both evacuated and local police warned people in the general vicinity to stay inside and close exterior vents and windows. Through Tuesday evening the fire was reduced and the order for a fire extinguisher robot from Oslo Fire and Rescue was canceled.\n\nThe airport closure also led to Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg being stranded after a visit to the Johan Sverdrup oil field. Solberg posted on Twitter asking for places to eat for the seven hour drive from Stavanger to the capital of Oslo.\n\nReports as of Wednesday said an estimated two to three hundred vehicles had been damaged or destroyed, but no humans had been hurt.\n\nBy about 22:00 local time (2100 UTC) on Tuesday the flames were under control. Local firefighters planned to continue to monitor the situation and work to prevent further damage. It was also discovered the structure was built without sprinklers. Stavanger Airport, Sola was to open on Wednesday morning, but returning to normal service was expected to take longer. Affected travelers were advised to contact their airlines for rebooking.",

The area the plane was flying over is a conflict zone currently between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatist forces.\n\nUnited States officials confirmed the aircraft has been shot down, according to data from a surveillance satellite which showed the last trajectory and impact of the missile. The missile is believed to be a Buk M1 surface-to-air missile which are believed to be in the hands of rebels according to reports from the area.\n\nSo far no party has claimed responsibility for the attack. Ukrainian officials denied the missile which shot down the airliner belonged to Ukraine. Pavlo Klimkin, Ukraine's foreign minister, said to The Guardian, \"We are absolutely sure and we checked yesterday that no missiles have been taken from the Ukrainian army\". The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) published on YouTube an alleged wiretap of separatist commanders and Russian intelligence officers discussing the shoot-down and acknowledging the aircraft shot down was civilian.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's defense ministry has denied involvement, posting a statement on their website which read, \"In view of various types of speculation concerning operations of the Russian armed forces in the areas bordering Ukraine, we affirm that the anti-aircraft means of the Russian armed forces did not operate in that region July 17\".\n\nUkrainian president Petro Poroshenko said, \"This was not an 'incident', this was not a 'catastrophe', this was a terrorist act\". Malyasian prime minister Najib Razak, said, \"If it transpires that the flight was shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice.\"\n\nAll civilian aircraft have been barred from flying over eastern Ukraine. The US's Federal Aviation Adminstration issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) prohibiting flight operations by United States carriers over eastern Ukraine. However, questions remain as to why the aircraft was flying over the contested area. Eurocontrol noted airspace was closed up to 32,000 feet. Flight 17 was flying at 33,000 feet just above the restricted airspace. Malaysia Airlines issued a statement saying \"The usual flight route was earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The International Air Transportation Association (IATA) has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions.\"",

He was 65.\n\nBorn in Gmunden in 1951, Schiff made his orchestral début in 1971. His 1978 recording début earned him an Artist of the Year award at the Deutsche Schallplattenpreis. After achieving worldwide acclaim he retired as a soloist in 2012 following a 2008 stroke, becoming a conductor instead. He had already been taking conducting jobs as a sideline from the late 1980s.\n\nSchiff studied at the Vienna Music Academy, and conducting roles included with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Philharmonia Orchestra, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, the Northern Sinfonia, and the Vienna Chamber Orchestra. Instructing jobs included at the Cologne Academy of Music and Dance, the University of Basel, the Salzburg Mozarteum, and Vienna's University of Music and the Pictorial Arts.\n\nAwards included the French Grand Prix du Disque. Performances included the 1988 German Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival, attended by the UK's Prince Charles.\n\nSchiff complained in 1988 classical music was \"very much mistreated\" by contemporary artists. \"Take the Mozart violin concertos,\" he said. \"If you hear any of the top ten violinists playing them it's beautiful sound, fine technique, but the style is hopelessly wrong &amp;mdash; it's almost a different language.\"\n\nFellow cellist Steven Isserlis said last year Schiff credited the music of Bach with his recovery following the 2008 stroke. \"He looked at me, and said quietly: 'Bach saved my life'\", Isserlis said. \"I asked him what he meant and he told me that a few years ago, he had a serious stroke, and was in danger of losing all mobility on his left side. As soon as he got to hospital, and realised what was happening, he started (almost instinctively, I imagine) to go through the fingerings of the Prelude to Bach’s first suite, moving his fingers ceaselessly to the imaginary music. He did this for about 20 hours a day, he thinks; and gradually his whole body came back to life, powered by those fingerings.\" Isserlis lamented the \"terrible, terrible\" loss of a \"person with a core of true goodness and humanity; and a wonderfully serious, genuine musician\".\n\nSchiff died early yesterday morning in a Vienna hospital.",

The mice, as a whole, were kept frozen in temperatures of -20 degrees celsius.\n\nScientists at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research Bioresource Center which is located in Tsukuba, Japan, say that cryogenic techniques were not used and that the mice were kept in a freezer.\n\nScientists also say that the sperm was not alive when it was thawed out. At least one out of every five females that were injected with the sperm, gave birth to healthy offspring which are also fertile.\n\n\"Obviously, those frozen sperm were all dead in the conventional sense. Motionless sperm had no chance whatsoever of fertilising in vivo or in vitro. Nevertheless, some of these, if not all, were ... genomically intact, because they were able to produce apparently normal offspring,\" said the researchers.\n\nThe idea behind the experiment is that scientists say that the results now make it possible to bring back prehistoric animals or extinct animals such as the woolly mammoth, but because any fully intact body found would have been frozen for over 10,000 years and would likely be too damaged organisms and bacterias. Endangered species such as elephants could also be reproduced, but scientists also say that the chances of an experiment like that of being successful are still \"slim.\"\n\n\"Restoration of extinct species could be possible if male individuals are found in permafrost. If sperm of extinct mammalian species, for example the woolly mammoth, can be retrieved from animal bodies that were kept frozen for millions of years in permanent frost, live animals might be restored by injecting them into oocytes eggs from females of closely related species,\" said Dr. Narumi Ogonuki, head of the team who made the discovery.",

Apple Corps claims that Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store violates an agreement reached between the two companies in 1991, which barred Apple Computer from using the \"Apple\" brand in certain uses in the music business.\n\nThe trial is set to begin on Wednesday in the Royal Courts of Justice, located in central London. Presiding Judge Martin Mann has stated that he owns an iPod portable music player, which is made by Apple Computer and marketed alongside the iTunes Music Store.\n\nApple Corps has twice before sued Apple Computer over its use of the \"Apple\" name. The first lawsuit was settled out of court in 1981, with the young computer maker paying $80,000 and agreeing to stay out of the music business.\n\nIn the late 1980's Apple Computer added audio recording abilities to its Macintosh computers, prompting Apple Corps to file suit again in 1989. That lawsuit was settled in 1991, also out of court, with Apple paying $26.5 million. The settlement included a more specific agreement over the boundaries between the two brands: Apple Computer was allowed to use its name to market \"goods or services...used to reproduce, run, play or otherwise deliver such music content,\" but barred from distributing music on a physical medium such as CD or cassette.\n\nApple Corps' latest suit, filed in September 2003, claims that the computer company violated the 1991 agreement with its iTunes Music Store, which sells digital music that can be downloaded to personal computers. A statement from Apple Computer stated that \"Apple and Apple Corps now have differing interpretations of this agreement and will need to ask a court to resolve this dispute.\" Some observers have suggested that the wording of the 1991 agreement, which did not explicitly bar digital music distribution, could be to Apple Computer's advantage.\n\nA similar suit was filed simultaneously in California, Apple Computer's home state, but on September 21, 2004 the parties agreed to have the case heard by the UK court.\n\nBeatles songs have not been licensed for digital download on any of the online music services.\n\nApple Corps was founded by the Beatles in 1968. Apple Computer was started by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976, and launched the iTunes Music Store in 2003.",

He said it was impossible to check the bags of all attendees, and they had decided to carry out random bag checks instead.\n\nEvent organisers have promised full refunds will be offered for people who no longer wish to attend the show.\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison gave his condolences and said: \"All our kids will be going to the Royal Easter Show. My kids will be going to the Royal Easter show. We want them to be safe. This is a very distressing event. The violence that is there, that has no place. It has no place in this country. It has no place at an event where people are coming to enjoy themselves.\"\n\nSuperintendent Danielle Emerton of the New South Wales Police Force has reassured people the show is still safe and asked for the public's help to find others involved in the stabbing. She said: \"We know that there were thousands of people at the show last night and we know that there's a lot of vision that is out there,\" urging anyone with information about the incident to come forward.",

The train stood at the station for about sixty seconds before moving off, leaving about seventy potential passengers standing on the platform.\n\n\"The guard looked at me and laughed,\" said one commuter. Some passengers became very angry, yelling at the station attendant and cursing CityRail. \"The rail system is a bloody joke!\" another commuter yelled.\n\nThe station attendant arranged for one of the Western Line express services to stop at Harris Park, which satisfied commuters who, by this time, had started to demand their money back. However, some Harris Park passengers may have been inconvenienced because the train they were forced to catch did not stop at all stations. The next all-stations train was scheduled to arrive half an hour later.\n\nCityRail has stated that the doors were not opened by the train guard because of confusion over the timetable. The train was carrying a guard trainer and a trainee guard. According to a CityRail spokeswoman, they were not aware that the train was going to be stopping at Harris Park.\n\n\"The fault is with the guard and they have been disciplined accordingly,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\nWhen questioned about reports of the guard laughing at passengers on the platform, the spokeswoman said that she had no information that this had occurred. She said that it was possible that the guards did not even realise that they were stopped at a station. Video footage from the station was used during the investigation.\n\nMany commuters have expressed their dissatisfaction at the state of the rail network for some time, with many writing to major Sydney newspapers. As a result, timetable changes have been implemented by CityRail and the New South Wales state government, justifying the changes as being necessary to improve safety and reliability. The new CityRail timetable, which commenced on September 1, resulted in a decreased service from Harris Park. There are now only two city trains departing between 8am and 9am, down from the previous four - the next train from that station to arrive after 9:12am is at 9:42am.",

    "original_text": "ScientologyA new book released today by author Marc Headley, Blown for Good, reveals details inside Scientology headquarters at the organization's \"Gold Base\", located near Hemet, California. Headley joined the organization at age seven when his mother became a member, and worked at Scientology's International Management Headquarters for several years before leaving in 2005.\n\nWhile an employee of the Scientology headquarters located in Riverside County, California, Headley had the experience of practicing Scientology counseling services called \"auditing\" with Scientologist Tom Cruise, shortly after the actor had completed work on the film Days of Thunder. In 1990, Cruise was training to become proficient in the Scientology auditing techniques, and Headley was selected to become the actor's auditing partner. Though a young actor at the age of 28, Cruise was already known for his work on films including Top Gun and Born on the Fourth of July. Headley writes in the book that he was chosen to work with Cruise because he had not yet progressed in Scientology levels, and because he was seen as a low security risk due to his young age at the time. Headley writes that he worked with Cruise for hours and hours each day, for a period of three weeks, on Scientology techniques called \"Training Routines\".\n\nThe book provides details of what life was like for the author inside the organization's headquarters. The inner flap of the book includes a map of the \"International Headquarters of Scientology; Gilman Hot Springs, California\". Headley writes that under the direction of Scientology leader David Miscavige, employees who signed billion-year contracts routinely put in 100-hour weeks of work for minimal pay. According to Headley, possible discipline faced by the Scientology employees for perceived mistakes included being separated from family as part of the Scientology policy of \"disconnection\", being declared a \"suppressive person\", or being sent to the \"Rehabilitation Project Force\", a program where Scientologists were assigned harsh labor.\n\nHeadley's tasks while working at the Scientology compound Gold Base included dealing with audiovisual equipment used for organization presentations and speeches by Miscavige, and supervising production of thousands of audiotapes of lectures given by Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard. From 1989 to 2005 Headley worked at the Scientology film production studio on scripts for movies which would be used to instruct new members of the organization on its practices. He faced repercussions from Miscavige if he could not meet production quotas. Headley asserts that he was physically abused by Miscavige, a claim made previously by other former Scientology officials in a series of investigative articles published in the St. Petersburg Times.\n\nThe book gives background on a 9-minute long video of Tom Cruise, leaked to the Internet in January 2008, that featured the actor discussing his views on Scientology. The Church of Scientology's attempts to remove the leaked video from the Internet motivated the group Anonymous to focus its efforts against the organization. Headley writes that initially the promotional video about Cruise was supposed to feature celebrities including Will Smith speaking about the actor, but Miscavige instead insisted Cruise should simply talk about himself.\n\nHeadley describes a form of Miscavige's management previously related in the St. Petersburg Times, where the Scientology leader made his staff play musical chairs to the Queen song \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Miscavige told 70 Scientology executives that they were to compete for chairs, and that only the last individual left after several rounds would remain at the compound, while the other executives would be assigned to remote locations. After a dramatic competition with multiple staffers in tears that they would be separated from their families, Miscavige stated no one would be removed from the compound.\n\nIn 2005, Headley left the Scientology compound in Hemet on a motorcycle, and fell off his vehicle after being chased by Scientology security guards. Riverside County police helped Headley escape from the Scientology security. Headley traveled to Kansas City to meet his father. He was later joined by his wife Claire who had also worked at the Gold Base compound.\n\n4=The John and Ken Show\nHeadley filed suit against Scientology in January 2009. In the legal case, he asserts that Scientology violated United States labor law with regard to his treatment while an employee of the organization. Headley and his lawyer Barry Van Sickle succeeded against attempts by the organization to get the suit dismissed. Headley's lawsuit is set to begin in U.S. federal court in November 2010.\n\n4=The Village Voice\nAmerican talk radio hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou discussed the book Wednesday on their program The John and Ken Show on KFI. \"This is, the Scientology cult, is I guarantee you, a thousand times more bizarre than you could have ever imagined. And what these celebrities do, like Tom Cruise, is a thousand times more strange than you could ever imagine. I have never read about behavior like this in my life, I can't imagine it. It's really weird,\" commented one of the hosts about material revealed by Headley in the book. Headley writes in the book that he started to question his involvement in Scientology when secretly listening to The John and Ken Show and watching Conan O'Brien make fun of Scientology celebrities. The National Enquirer reported on the release of Blown for Good, calling it an \"explosive new book\".\n\nThe book was reviewed Wednesday by the Editor in chief of The Village Voice, Tony Ortega, who characterized it as a \"remarkable account\". \"Headley's book also provides stunning material that has rarely been collected in one place, even with the Internet's deep resources on L. Ron Hubbard's strange creation. Headley's story provides a damning account of life working for Scientology leader David Miscavige at the secretive desert base\", wrote Ortega in the review. He commented, \"Perhaps the best service that Headley provides with Blown for Good is giving non-Scientologists the sense of what it's really like to work, day in and day out, in such a strange organization, from the lowliest laborer mucking out excrement in a Gold Base pond (Headley says shit was coming out of his ears and pores for days) to what kind of luxuries the celebrities and high-ranking members enjoy.\"\n\nHYS",

    "original_text": "Todd J. Shriber has been fired as the communications director for U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg (R-MT), after it was disclosed that he attempted to hire people associated with the website attrition.org to hack into his former university, Texas Christian University, to have his GPA grades raised. Once his superiors learned of the scandal, he was immediately fired. \"He just wasn't exhibiting the kind of veracity that we need and demand out of our employees,\" said Erik Iverson, Rehberg's chief of staff.\n\nShriber's opening email shows considerable naivety, assuming the attrition security site is run by hackers he can employ.\nI came across Attrition.org for the first time. I enjoyed the site though I am not an expert with computers. That brings me to my next point: I need to urgently make contact with a hacker that would be interested in doing a one-time job for me. The pay would be good. I'm not sure what exactly the job would entail with respect to computer jargon, but I can go into rough detail upon making contact with a candidate. Thanks for your help.\n\nA brief exchange of email messages confirms that Shriber is completely unaware that not all hackers will perform illegal acts, on August 9 he said in email to the \"security curmudgeon\" of Attrition, \"OK here it is: I need an adjustment to my college GPA.\nIs this an absurd request?\". The response leads Schriber into believing that he has found someone to carry out the job for him. Security Curmudgeon warns Shriber that he is soliciting the commission of a federal offense, and requests personally identifying information that would be required for the break in plus \"picture of a squirrel or pigeon on your campus. One close-up, one with background that shows buildings, a sign, or something to indicate you are standing on the campus.\"\n\nThe exchange continues, up until Shriber reveals college details such as his student ID, username, and password. A second member of the attrition team, Lyger, coaxes date of birth and social security details from Shriber also telling him, \"we still have to\ntake unique precautions in order to be successful. Please mention this project to absolutely nobody, even your closest friends. The smallest leak could lead to compromise.\"\n\nSmattering messages with comical jargon, Lyger convinces Shriber that they are in fact breaking into Texas Christian University for him. He tells them he will be unavailable for some time and will ready a list of changes he'd like made to his GPA. This is followed by Lyger deciding to end the game, \"we are SO busted... i've already been called twice by my isp asking about unusual activity,...stuff that finally got me access all goes back to your login sorry\". Lyger advises Shrieber to \"duck and run\", telling him never to visit the attrition.org site again. The email messages were then published on the site.",

His play had cinched a perfect season for his undefeated Fennville High School basketball team before an exuberant crowd.\n\nAs Leonard lay motionless on his back, the audience became silent. A witness on the court said Leonard had ceased to breathe and his heart had stopped. Attempts to revive him failed and he was transported to a nearby hospital where he died a little over an hour later. An autopsy revealed that Leonard had an enlarged heart, causing the cardiac arrest that killed him.\n\nIt is unclear from media reports whether the school had an automated external defibrillator (AED) available for emergencies, or if the ambulance personnel had employed such equipment. Also unknown is how much time elapsed from the moment the player collapsed until the time a defibrillator was employed. Many schools have acquired defibrillators for such emergencies, according to Michigan High School Athletic Association spokesman John Johnson. He said the devices at schools are not mandated by law nor by the association's regulations. There is evidence that if, in the first 10 minutes of a cardiac arrest, an AED is used, up to 80% of the victims can survive. Emergency responders usually need at least seven minutes to arrive on the scene.\n\nNews media describes Leonard’s death as shocking the community. His coach described him as a healthy and disciplined athlete who was the top scorer on his basketball team as well as the quarterback of the school's football team which won its conference's championship this season.\n\nDr. Marc Lahiri, a specialist in disorders of heart rhythm for Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital, said that detecting underlying heart abnormalities is difficult and such defects may not become apparent until the occurrence of a sudden and perhaps fatal event. Lahiri said many doctors are encouraging schools to make extensive testing of the heart routine for physicals given to school athletes. Such testing is controversial, not only because of the cost but because of possible false-positives that may lead to the need for additional testing.",

China has also increased its marine surveillance of the area in recent months.\n\nThe release of such detailed plans by the Japan Defense Agency sends a strong message to China&amp;mdash;that Japan plans to protect its claimed administrative rights over the area at all costs. Many Japanese believe \"that their government should take an even tougher stance toward China\", according to Ho Szu-shen, an associate professor in the Department of Japanese at Fu-jen Catholic University.\n\nThe Chinese government has not yet commented publicly about the release of the Japanese defense plans for the islands. However, in December, the state-run People's Daily newspaper editorialized that Japan's multi-year Defense Forces Reorganization Plan attempts to \"play up Chinese military threats.\" China is also unhappy with Japan's plans to build a missile defense system in cooperation with the United States.\n\nSovereignty of the island is disputed between Japan and China. Both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China claims soveregnty on the island.\n\nDespite Japan's claims of sovereignty over the islands, China has begun to claim some of the region's valuable oil and natural gas deposits to help alleviate the shortages for China's growing economy. China recently allowed leased oil drilling to commence within the area that Japan has declared as an \"Economic Exclusion Zone\". Japan has lodged diplomatic protests to ask China to discontinue these projects, but China does not recognize Japan's claims, arguing that Chinese territorial rights end at the edge of the Asian continental shelf underneath the East China Sea.\n\nOn March 24, 2004, seven Chinese activists were arrested by Japanese authorities when they landed on the islands with the intent to stay for three days. At the time, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a protest with the PRC. The activists were deported by Japan after the PRC demanded their return.\n\nThe name of the island chain is disputed. The Japanese refer to the islands as \"Sento Shosho\" or \"Senkaku Retto,\" the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (Taiwan) call the island the same name. In PRC's pinyin system, the names spells \"Diaoyu Dao\" and in ROC's system \"Tiao Yu Tai.\"",

    "original_text": "A Russian mathematician, Grigori (\"Grisha\") Perelman, who is credited proving the Poincaré conjecture declined to accept the Fields Medal, regarded as the highest honor in the field of mathematics.\n\nThe Fields Medal, often referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of mathematics\", was awarded this year to Andrei Okounkov (Russia/US), Terence Tao (Australia/US) and Wendelin Werner (France) in addition to Perelman. The award was handed out by King Juan Carlos of Spain and is accompanied by a C$15'000 (approximately US$13'400 or 10'400EUR) cash prize (less than the one million Euros that come with the Nobel prize). Nominees have to be under 40 years, because the founder of the award, Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields wanted the medal to be a stimulus for future endeavours.\n\nPerelman submitted two papers in 2002 and 2003 outlining a proof for Thurston's geometrization conjecture, which in turn, implies a proof for the Poincaré conjecture. Other mathematicians filling in the details have found no flaws in Perelman's approach yet. In 2003, Perelman made a short tour in the United States to explain his proof of the conjecture. When he went back to the St Petersburg department of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics, he gave up his job, and is reported to be unemployed and living with his mother ever since.\n\n\"The reason Perelman gave me is that he feels isolated from the mathematical community and therefore has no wish to appear as one of its leaders.\" declared Manuel de Leon, chairman of the Congress, when asked about Grisha's motivation to decline. Prof. John Ball, retiring president of the International Mathematical Union, added: \"The reason centres on his feeling of isolation from the mathematical community.\" Perelman's friend Anatoly Vershik said the reclusive math genius just wanted to be declared correct, and regarded recognition as superficial.\n\nThe Poincaré conjecture is widely considered one of the most important questions in topology (a branch of mathematics concerned with spatial properties preserved under deformation like stretching without tearing or gluing). It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems for which the Clay Mathematics Institute is offering a $1,000,000 prize for a correct solution.\n\nObservers speculate that he will also refuse this prize. In 1997, he also refused an award by the European Congress of Mathematicians, because he deemed the judges unable to understand his work. A spokesman for the Institute said it would decide on the prize in two years. Richard Hamilton's \"Ricci flow\" equation could also earn him a part of the prize, since it formed the basis for Perelman's papers.\n\nIn 1966, German Alexander Grothendieck refused his Fields Medal in Moscow out of protest against the presence of the Red Army in Eastern Europe. But later he accepted it.\n\nThe Poincaré conjecture is not an easy thing to explain in plain English. A sphere as we know it is called a two-dimensional sphere in topology (because it's surface can be approximated by a two-dimensional plane). The four-dimensional analogue of such a 2-sphere is a 3-sphere (which is an example of a 3-manifold).\n\nNow imagine a ball and a donut made of rubber. If you throw a lasso around the ball and pull, you can squeeze it to a single point and slide off the lasso. But you can't do that with the noose through the hole of a donut, the only way is to cut through the donut. So in topology, there are basically two kinds of objects: objects with or without holes. By deforming objects without holes you can make them look like a sphere, but this is impossible for objects with holes. So basically, Grisha proved that in topology a ball and a banana are the same.\n\nThe Poincaré conjecture surmises that if a closed three-dimensional manifold (our multiple-dimension banana) is sufficiently like a 3-sphere (a kind of hypersphere) in that each loop in the manifold can be tightened to a point, then it is really just a three-dimensional sphere.",

    "original_text": "On Wednesday, the New South Wales, Australia Department of Primary Industries (DPI) reported fifteen percent of New South Wales, Australia (NSW) was in \"intense drought\", and the rest of the state \"in drought\" or \"drought-affected\". Farmers were reportedly running out of food for cattle and had to make difficult decisions about the collection times for their crops; food for cattle became harder to get, and more expensive.\n\nThe report from DPI indicated \"up to 48% of the state as Drought Affected, 37% in Drought and 15% in Intense Drought\". The areas of intense drought included \"parts of Western, North West, Central West, Central Tablelands, South East, Hunter, Greater Sydney and Northern Tablelands LLS regions\", according to the report. The drought indicator was based on agronomic data, remote sensing, and field reports, including soil moisture and pasture conditions.\n\nThe report from DPI named \"the southern alpine zone, the greater Hilltops (Young) region and parts of the south and north coast\" as areas with better conditions.\n\nFurthermore, according to ABC (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation), the chair of the Australian Fodder Industry Association, Frank McRae, said many farmers in NSW had barely any food for their cattle. He said, \"There's pretty much virtually nothing in NSW and supplies are rapidly drying up in southern Victoria state bordering NSW on the south ... You have to go back to 1981&amp;ndash;1982 to see a drought this widespread and so severe.\"\n\nThe BBC reported Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull saying some farmers bought hay for animal feed for as much as AUD 10,000 per truckload.\n\nNSW Primary Industries Minister Niall Blair remarked many people were hoping for rain to come and farmers were needed to make difficult decisions about the best viable time for crops collection. He said, \"This is tough, there isn't a person in the state that isn't hoping to see some rain for our farmers and regional communities ... Producers are now faced with some very difficult decisions on whether to graze sown crops or rely on potential rainfall in the next two months in order to increase yield production.\"\n\nAccording to ABC's reports, Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) meteorologist Jane Golding said these conditions were unlike previously observed climatic conditions in NSW with rain in June, July and August. He said, \"This year we haven't really seen either of those and last year as well we didn't really see too much of the either of those rain-bearing systems making their way into NSW ... It is unusually dry and also unusually warm which exacerbates the problems, so the warm temperatures dry out the soils even more.\"\n\nAccording to BBC, Queensland, north of NSW, was also experiencing dry conditions, as well as parts of South Australia and Victoria. The report from DPI mentioned last autumn's failed growing season.\n\nAbout the forecast conditions and risks, the report from DPI said dry and warm conditions were \"likely\" to continue in the next three months, with an El Niño 50% likely in NSW in spring, which would mean depressed rainfall. The Australian forecasting services have an El Niño Watch on the region according to the report.",

The fires have reportedly destroyed hundreds of homes and shops and hundreds of people are said to have fled from the area. On Friday, people returning to the area and onlookers were chased away by soldiers.\n\nSpeaking to the Associated Press, Army Brigadier General Samuel Salihu denied that Nigerian troops were responsible for the arson. He said that militants active in the area had set the fires, wearing Army camouflage.\n\nOn Thursday, oil workers were kidnapped from a bar near the slums by armed men who shot dead an Army soldier guarding the workers, and injured another soldier. Nigerian military sources said at least two foreign oil workers were missing, one of them, Italian. The Italian foreign ministry, though, said that three foreigners were missing.\n\nThe oil-rich Niger Delta region has witnessed a spate of kidnappings recently. Nineteen people were held captive in eight separate abductions this month. All but three of them have been released since, some after the state government and the oil companies paid a ransom.\n\nThe Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), a militant group which has taken hostages and attacked oil facilities, but says it does not kidnap for ransom, said in a statement that it the state government has encouraged such abductions by paying ransoms.\n\nLast week, as part of a tougher line adopted by the Nigerian government, President Obasanjo sent in the Army, with orders to use \"force for force\" against militants in the region. Over 160 people were taken into custody in a two day crackdown, including over 100 from a nearby slum, but most have been released since then.\n\nThe BBC's Alex Last reports that local leaders and oil companies are concerned that this new tough policy will increase tensions in the region.",

    "original_text": "Digital radio listeners in the UK may have noticed a new station on their list over the last few months with the beta launch of Amazing Radio, founded by Paul Campbell as a follow up and companion to Amazing Tunes. However, unlike the majority of the other stations on both digital and FM, Amazing Radio doesn't play normal, mainstream music. Instead, its playlist consists solely of music from unsigned bands and artists who have signed up and uploaded their music to AmazingTunes.com. Their music can then be downloaded from the site, for which they get paid. The more downloads and interest an artist receives, the more likely they are to get played on the national radio station. Amazing markets itself as an \"ethical\" download website, on which artists get 70% of the download revenues. They now have more than 22,000 songs uploaded, with about 100 uploaded every day.\nsource=Paul Campbell\nPaul Campbell himself has extensive experience in both radio and television production, having worked for BBC Radio 4 and Channel 4. After success with his own production company in the nineties and with support from investors, Campbell launched Amazing Tunes in 2005.\n\nAs Amazing Radio introduces a new schedule for the New Year, with presenters rather than solely pre-recorded links, Wikinews reporter Tristan Thomas interviewed Campbell to find out more.\n\nWikinewsHi Paul, thanks for doing this interview.\n\nPaul CampbellMy pleasure – thanks very much for asking me. We’re really grateful that Wikinews is interested in us.\n\nWNAt the end of 2009, you complained to the BBC Trust about BBC Introducing. Can you explain what this was about and the reasons for it. Has anything come of it?\n\nPCSure: in a nutshell, the complaint was about unfair competition - about the BBC not following its own rules. It’s still ongoing. It will take, ahem, a while to resolve.\n\nThe details are a bit complex, but here goes. (If you commit suicide out of the boredom at what follows, I apologise).\n\nAs British readers will know, the BBC has a guaranteed and very comfortable income derived from the Licence Fee - effectively a tax you have to pay if you want a TV. According to Wikipedia (so it must be true), this generates an income to the BBC of about stg4.5bn per annum. Nice.\nsource=Paul Campbell\nNot really. In recent years the beeb has increasingly used this gargantuan income - and its incredible audience reach online, on radio &amp; TV - to launch new services that make life impossible for everyone who is not the BBC. These have ranged from e-learning content (that completely wrecked the market for private publishers), to a new digital radio station (that caused a private speech station to go bust), to an attempt to launch online regional news services (which caused howls of outrage from local newspapers). The BBC does it for the best of reasons – to provide a public service – but BBC people live in an insulated, publicly-funded world, one where you know with complete certainty you’ll get paid on the 15th of every month. It’s a million miles away from the real world, where entrepreneurial people take risks, and lose their jobs and their houses if it goes wrong. Here, the BBC’s actions have grave implications. And not just for private companies: the UK as a whole is very good at creative industries, which are the fastest-growing part of the economy. But it’s kinda hard to grow a global business if your domestic market has been wrecked by a rampaging, publicly-funded, bull in a china shop. So by accidentally knackering private companies, the BBC is also damaging the British economy.\n\nWise people noticed this. A few years ago the Governance of the BBC was changed. A new regulator, the BBC Trust, was created. It tried to address the problem. It insists the Corporation does a 'public value test' when it wants to launch a new service, or to expand an existing one.\n\nHere, it hasn't. Although the BBC has a longstanding commitment to play new music on its local radio stations, and one of its most famous DJs John Peel had an outstanding show on BBC Radio 1 for many years which played new music (and was, incidentally, produced by one of our new presenters), it's suddenly changed the game. It’s launched a huge expansion and automation of this formerly piecemeal and limited activity, targeted exclusively at unsigned bands. BBC Introducing is a pan-BBC brand, combining local and network radio, television, online, even a special stage at Glastonbury. There's a very expensive online upload service which I just know would have cost ten times what we had to spend on our similar service. There's a Head of Department, doubtless with dozens of staff. I’ll bet they have BBC Introducing pens. It's everywhere.\n\nThis is, by any reckoning, a ‘new service’. But it’s not been subjected to a public value test. Worse, I have it on very good authority from someone inside the BBC that BBC Worldwide - its commercial arm - is planning to launch a BBC Introducing record label – i.e., an overtly commercial expansion of BBC Introducing. This would be like the BBC trying to create a new version of the music industry, all by itself.\n\nWhether or not you think it's a good thing for the beeb to champion new music, you may agree it should follow its own rules. It hasn’t. There was no Public Value Test; no request to the Trust to be allowed to do this.\n\nSo we complained. It was a bit hilarious. The Trust said they weren't allowed to investigate until we'd complained to the beeb itself and the BBC had rejected our complaint. There was a long pause as I tried to understand the logic. I said ‘I’m guessing the BBC didn’t do a PVT because it didn’t think it needed to do a PVT. We think they should have done. We’re asking you to investigate, to see if you agree’. They said ‘you have to complain to them first. It’s protocol’. It's all very British - i.e., charmingly polite … ludicrously bureaucratic … and totally useless.\n\nSo we have another hoop to jump through. We're now preparing our formal complaint to the BBC itself - whose Director General is someone I used to work with, when we were both fresh-faced BBC trainees in 1981. It takes time: I’ll have to write it myself, and I have a business to run. The beeb will have a small army of staff whose only job is to read it … and reject it. (They always reject criticism; it's the BBC's default position. They usually do it with a slightly pained expression, hurt that anyone could fail to understand their brilliance and omniscience. Either that, or they try to demolish your intellect and cast doubt on your probity. Either way, they'll reject it).\n\nWhen they do, we'll then be able to go back to the BBC Trust to say ‘guess what? The BBC rejected our complaint. Now will you investigate?’. Yawn.\nsource=Paul Campbell\nAll this might make me seem a BBC-hater. Actually nothing could be further from the truth. The BBC trained me. I was once, so I was told by the Head of Appointments, its youngest-ever Producer. Despite appearances, I firmly believe it's one of the best things about the UK. I wrote to The Times of London recently in defence of it. But unfortunately it's really, really bad at understanding the damage it does to private companies, the ones like ours that create jobs and try to create wealth, without the benefit of a guaranteed income. (Or even, any income at all).\n\nThe stakes are high. The conventional music industry is falling to bits around us. There’s an historic opportunity to re-invent music in a way that's fair to musicians and music-lovers, and also creates jobs and wealth in the real economy. It's vitally important the BBC, with its publicly-funded hobnailed boots, doesn't ruin that opportunity.\n\nSo we’ll do our complaint, wait for it to be rejected, complain to the Trust, and keep battering away. Fun fun fun. (This would never happen in the States).\n\nWNYou don't accept any PRS registered artists at all. Why not?\nDo you agree with Paul? Are PRS getting it completely wrong?\nPCWe’d love to – after all, we have the same aim as PRS, which is to make it easier for musicians to earn a living from their talent. But we can’t. There’s two reasons.\n\n:::1. PRS has a barmy standard contract for using their members’ music online. It requires us to pay them a fixed percentage of ALL revenue from that website – whether or not the revenue is derived from their members’ work. So if we had 100,000 songs from non-PRS artists on amazingtunes.com, and one song from a PRS artist, we’d have to pay them a percentage of the revenue from ALL 100,000 songs. I.e., we’d have to take money out of the pockets out of non-PRS artists to pay to PRS. That would be immoral.\n\n:::2. If we played PRS artists on the radio, we’d have to pay PRS for our use of their members’ music. Sound fair enough? But PRS doesn’t know what to do with the money. They’d put it into a big bucket, then share it out among ALL their artists - not the members whose songs we played, all their artists, including rich and famous signed ones. The vast majority of PRS payments go to a tiny minority of artists (and big record labels). So it would be another case of stealing from Peter to pay Paul. Paul McCartney, that is.\n\nI wrote to the CEO of PRS when we first launched Amazing Radio pointing out these absurdities and asking if we could do a more intelligent deal. I said that I thought we had identical aims – to make life fair for musicians. I suggested we could/should be a feeder to them, introducing new members to PRS as they grew in the music industry. But so far, the PRS head is still firmly in the sand.\n\nWNAnd how would you suggest PRS could improve? If they did, would you consider allowing artists registered with them?\n\nPCPRS could improve by;\n\n:::a. buying some computers (so they could handle our comprehensive data about the tracks we play, and then pay the right people);\n:::b. accepting that we want to mix PRS and non-PRS artists, and only asking for a share of the artists they actually represent.\n\nIf they did that, we’d sign up. This would not necessarily be popular with our audience. A lot of people – especially charities and small businesses – like the fact that they can listen to Amazing Radio without a PRS licence. But we’d do it anyway, as it would be a better service for musicians.\nsource=Paul Campbell\nMy personal view is that the PRS should also stop threatening to murder law-abiding people who want to listen to music at work. There was a recent case where they threatened someone for singing at work. They actually did that. They later apologized, but it revealed the corporate mentality. I think it’s incredibly counter-productive; it means their members make less money, not more; it’s ruining perceptions of what motivates musicians; it’s causing thousands of people to stop listening to music. When really, PRS should be encouraging that, shouldn’t it?\n\nWNWith regard to Amazing Tunes, how many downloads could your most popular artist expect to receive per month and monetary wise, how would this compare to them receiving that number from iTunes?\n\nPCSorry, but we don’t currently release detailed figures – our competitors would love it, but we’d rather be nice to our artists and our investors instead. We do say that we expect amazingtunes.com artists to make ‘anything from a few quid, to a good living, to a small fortune’. At the moment, because it’s still very early days, people are clustered towards the first two of those options. As things grow – and there’s been incredible growth even in the past few months – we hope/expect more and more artists will start to make tens of thousands of pounds each month. We’ll soon register for the official chart, and our guess is that someone will have a major hit before long. Then everything will go really crazy.\n\nSo far as the iTunes comparisons go, the facts are already public domain. An artist on iTunes can expect to make 8p from a 79p download. The same artist on amazingtunes.com will make about 52p. We only deduct the VAT and the cost of the transaction: 70% of what’s left goes to the artist. What’s more, their income will improve over time - the more downloads we sell, the less the transactions cost us, so the more cash there is to give to the artists. That’s one reason we ask people to buy eight or more songs in one transaction – it’s much more cost-effective, less of their cash goes to VISA, more to the artist. (See my Blog post on this here - ).\n\nWNAmazing Radio launched in mid-2009. How has it grown since then and what are your current listening figures?\n\nPCIt’s gone mad since then. I’ve worked in broadcasting and the media since 1978 (I was very very young then, mind you). I’ve never known anything like it. The reaction has been absolutely incredible – and it’s growing faster than ever right now. The most humbling thing has been the audience feedback – masses of long emails from people we’ve never met, saying they found it by accident, and they love it.\nsource=Paul Campbell\nWe’ve not yet paid for RAJAR audience figures because – well, because we’re a bit mean really, and I’m not convinced they would accurately measure our audience. I think RAJAR is very good at coming out with figures for radio stations that have been going for 40 years, but not very accurate when it comes to new and innovative stations which are also listened to a lot online and especially popular with young people. But the best guess I’ve heard in the industry is that we have something like 600,000 listeners in the UK on DAB. That’s an estimate, but it came from a very wise source. We have slightly more than that number on top as regular users online, and a weekly reach for amazingtunes.com of about two million users. But it’s all growing so fast, those numbers will be out of date by the time you read this.\n\nWNDAB transmission costs are well over half a million pounds a year. How is this being funded currently and how are you planning to fund it in the future?\n\nPCWe’re not contractually allowed to tell you what we pay, so we can’t confirm or deny the cost. Whatever the true figure, it is undeniably expensive; but it gives our musicians a chance to be on national radio. We figure it’s worth it. I’m reminded of that wonderful teachers’ union bumper sticker: ‘if you think education’s expensive, try ignorance’. If you think creating the world’s first radio station playing 100% new music is expensive …. try being inaudible.\n\nSo far, we’ve been funded by a very small number of private investors, people of enormous wisdom and insight, natch. They understand that we have a very serious, long-term and audacious ambition to change the music industry for the better, to make radio interesting again, and to turn the word ‘amazing’ into a global challenger brand.\n\nThis year, we expect to do one final fund-raising in the UK, then to raise a lot of money on the West Coast of the USA to make this absolutely massive and global, fast. They understand this scale of ambition there.\nHave you tuned into Amazing Radio? What did you think?\nWNWhat are your plans for Amazing Radio in 2010? Any exciting announcements to come?\n\nPC‘Fraid so.\n\nIn 2010, we hope to make Amazing Radio the default station for everyone who has ever had that incredible experience of hearing a song for the first time, and having to stop what you’re doing to listen to it: a station for everyone who has broad musical tastes, a respect for musical talent and an open mind. We want it to be constantly surprising, fresh, original, sometimes hilarious, always unexpected.\n\nBlimey, I sound like some corporate twat.\n\nNow (obviously) it wouldn’t be massively unexpected if we suddenly started revealing all the unexpected things in advance – but basically, we’d like the message to spread that we’re doing something different, fresh, original and ethical - so we’ll launch more new programmes and more new services – on Amazing Radio and amazingtunes.com. Things like our virtual radio station Amazing Ambient. . There’ll be some video and some TV along soon too. And other cool stuff.\n\nIt may not be ‘insanely cool’; just cool will do just fine.\n\nWe also want to do it in other places. E.g. America. We’ve already started there. We’ll be unexpected there too.\n\nWNFinally, your favourite artist on Amazing Tunes/Radio at the moment?\n\nPCNow this will sound like a real cop-out, but I never ever say who my favourite artist is. It’s for a serious reason. I’m not some musical Einstein - I’m merely the bloke who started amazing. And I’m merely a drummer. My taste doesn’t matter. EVERYBODY’s musical taste does. One of the many problems of conventional record companies is that they think geezers in suits in big glass buildings have the right to decide what’s good music. We think the world does. I’ve found hundreds of incredible songs that I love, across loads of styles of music. You’ll find hundreds of your own. Enjoy.\n\nWNThank you very much for your time Paul. Good luck for 2010.\n\nPCThanks very much, we really appreciate it. 2010 is going to be amazing.",

Reuters states Fukuda won the party presidential election which was held Sunday afternoon in Tokyo; he got 330 votes from eligible voters, lawmakers of the party and representatives of 47 prefecture level branches, thus defeating his sole opponent Taro Aso (67), the former foreign minister, who received 197 votes.\n\nChugoku Shimbun reports Aso got more votes than his core supporters had expected. On September 23, his supporters held a meeting in Tokyo but only 44 lawmakers attended. His supporters therefore guessed the total votes he would get would be around 90 but expect now his \"loss in a good fight\" rather strengthens his position in the party and hence in Japanese politics.\n\nYomiuri Shimbun reports that slightly larger number of party members voted for Aso than Fukuda in local level elections, while Fukuda got 76 votes of 141, which had been assigned to prefecture level LDP branches, and Aso received 65. LDP headquarter allows each branches to choose their preferable decision making way, and 35 branches choose voting. In those branches, 253,692 eligible voters voted Aso, 250,613 voted Fukuda. 12 branches didn't allow every member to join decision making, and Fukuda seized the support from eight of those 12 branches. Aso was strongly supported by the areas which have major cities, while Fukuda was supported in rural districts.\n\nSince LDP has lawmakers many enough to have their favorite person win the prime minister nomination, Fukuda is likely to succeed to Abe as prime minister also.

The flight originated in Iquitos, capital of the region, and had flown on to Orellana, where it had just taken off from when the accident occurred.\n\nSurvivors said after the crash that they had attempted to persuade the pilot not to takeoff in the adverse weather conditions, but they had been assured by Air Force personnel that they would be safe as they were on board a military aircraft.\n\nSurvivor Juan Saavedra said that, on takeoff, the pilot immediately began struggling to control the plane in high winds. It then dropped and flew between two trees, shearing off its wings. Another survivor said that immediately prior to the crash the pilot gave an order to turn off the engine in a move that is speculated to have been intended to prevent a post-impact fire.\n\nLocal officials said 20 people were on board, with police giving seven survivors and the Defence Ministry eight. No passenger list or official report has yet been released regarding the crash, but it is known that 13 bodies were recovered from the wreckage. Juan Montes, a police spokesman in the jungle village Contamana, supposed to be the aircraft's next stop, said that the plane had a three-man crew, all of whom were killed.\n\nMaria Luisa Armas, 93, the oldest resident of Contamana, is reported by survivors to have survived initially but insisted that other survivors leave her in the aircraft and go off to find help. She was one of the 13 deceased ultimately pulled out of the wreckage.\n\nThe survivors were taken to Pucallpa, which was supposed to be the last stop on the flight.\n\nAccording to the state news agency, Andina, homes had been deroofed and trees felled by powerful winds earlier the same day.",

    "original_text": "A new report on climate change's impact on agriculture predicts 25 million more malnourished children around the world by 2050, compared to a scenario with no global warming. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable.\n\nThe report from the International Food Policy Research Institute projects that the the number of malnourished children will decrease by 10 million in the next 40 years. However, without global warming the report projects a decrease of 35 million. Forty percent of undernourished children will live in Africa.\n\nThe report compares economic and biological factors affecting child nutrition in two future scenarios &amp;mdash; a world with and a world without climate change.\n\nGerard Nelson is lead researcher for the report at the International Food Policy Research Institute. He said that climate change will have a particularly strong impact on agricultural yields in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\"The food price crisis of last year really was a wake-up call to a lot of people that we are going to have 50% more people on the surface of the Earth by 2050. Meeting those demands for food coming out of population growth is going to be a huge challenge &amp;mdash; even without climate change,\" Nelson said.\n\n\"On top of that, sub-Saharan Africa in particular is home to a large number of poor people. And one of the key messages to take home from our analysis is that with higher incomes people are more resilient to a variety of changes and that will be especially true for climate change.\"\n\nThe report says that in 2050 average wheat yields in sub-Saharan Africa will decline by up to 22 percent as a result of climate change. Irrigation water supply is also expected to decrease and less food availability will mean on average 500 calories less per person.\n\nWithout climate change, the report projected a rise in calorie availability in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2050.\n\nNelson says African governments need to prioritise investment in the agriculture sector, particularly in rural roads, research and new technologies. With the December 2009 climate change talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, Nelson says African governments should focus on helping their farmers adapt to climate change.\n\n\"As the governments of sub-Saharan Africa prepare to go to the Copenhagen negotiations they should ensure that agriculture is included both in the adaptation funding mechanisms that will come out of Copenhagen as well as allow for the possibility that mitigation funds can be used in Africa,\" Nelson said.\n\nThe report says an additional investment in global agriculture of US$7 billion per year could increase production and counteract the adverse effects of climate change. The report says 40 percent of this investment should go to sub-Saharan Africa.",

The avalanche occurred at 11:15 local time (9:15 UTC) yesterday on Mount Zigana in the Gumushane region of Turkey near the Black Sea coast. Winter sports are increasing in popularity across Turkey, as it is mountainous.\n\nThe climbers were at a height of 7,260ft (2,200m) while crossing a deep valley, when the snow hit them. As search teams and locals arrived, they managed to pull seven climbers free from the snow; at least two were taken to hospital, one of which died in hospital. They were walking in a single-file line, as it hit them. One of the survivors made a hole with their arms, so they could breathe. The block of snow dragged them 1,000 metres into a valley as the avalanche traveled down the mountain.\n\nThe avalanche may have caused by rising temperatures in the area. A gun-shot was also considered as an outside possibility after some witnesses said they heard one.\n\nThis occurred as climbers were killed in Scotland after an avalanche, as well another seven deaths across the French Alps.",

The Westboro Baptist Church will be protesting outside the venue during her concert. Gaga warned of these protests on her Twitter page.\n\n\"At the risk of drawing attention to a hateful organization, I would like to make my little monster fan sic aware of a protest being held outside the Monsterball in St.Louis tonight. Although we have had protesters before, as well as fundamentalists at the show this group of protesters are hate criminals and preach using lude sic and violent language and imagery that I wish I could protect you all from.\"\n\nThe Church, based in Topeka, Kansas and not affiliated with any Baptist organization, had planned to protest at Gaga's prior concerts held in St. Louis. The most recent protest was scheduled in January and was later canceled prior to the concert. According to Shirley Phelps-Roper, a spokesperson for the church, \"God hates homosexuals and God hates fags and God hates whore Gaga,\" which is why the group plans a protest at tonight's concert.\n\n\"So when she gets up there and tries to hook God with that thing He calls an abomination; if you love what God hates, then God hates you,\" said Phelps-Roper in January. According to the church's website, the protest begins at 7:10 p.m. and lasts until 8:00 p.m.. \"Now what type of wicked hypocrites would we be if we did not warn this little false prophetess and all of her over-indulged sycophants that they are each one, individually heading straight to hell in a gender-confused, self-loathing, tone-deaf hand basket and that a gift from the God they hate? So, we made a couple of songs just for this event,\" said their website.\n\nGaga tells her fans to not listen to the group. \"My request to all little monsters and public authority is to pay these hate criminals no mind. Do not interact with them, or try to fight. Do not respond to any of their provocation. Don't waste your words, or feelings, no matter what you hear or see. You are more fortunate and blessed than they are, and in your heart just pray for them.

The two candidates together had spent more money on this campaign than on any other House contest in U.S. history, over US$50 million.\n\nThe congressional seat was left vacant when its previous congressman, Tom Price, accepted an offer to serve in President Donald Trump's cabinet. The sixth district is considered heavily Republican and has not been held by a Democrat since the 1970s. Despite this, 30-year-old Ossoff nearly won the initial election in April, with 48.1% of the vote. At that time, among several Republican candidates, Handel came away with 19.8% of the vote.\n\nSome, including Ossoff himself, characterized this election a chance for voters to indicate whether they truly approve or disapprove of the Trump presidency, saying that the election could \"send a message that will be heard across the country and around the world.\" After the election, he conceded, saying, \"As darkness has crept across this planet, Ossoff supporters have provided a beacon of hope for people here in Georgia and people around the world. We showed the world that in places where no one thought it was even possible to fight, we could fight.\"\n\nBoth candidates received death threats during the campaign and spoke with the press about violence in U.S. politics. In remarks to The Guardian, Handel said, \"The lack of civility in society as a whole, some of it, I believe, is very much fueled by social media and frankly, it's fueled by the fact that journalism is not journalism any more. It's tabloid. ... The anger has been from the left with groups of trackers showing up and literally adopting a gang-like posture and virtually stalking individuals.\"\n\nOssoff commented as well: \"This is a deep-rooted problem in American politics right now which is going to take work and bipartisan commitment to try to heal wounds and focus on substance instead of fear-mongering and slander.\" He specifically objected to an ad that he said politicized the recent shooting of Republican Representative Stephen Scalise by saying that violent leftists were voting for Ossoff.\n\nOver 140,000 people, an extraordinarily high number for a special election in the area, voted early.",

    "original_text": "President Jacques Chirac of France has accepted the resignation of prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin and has named Dominique de Villepin in his place.\n\nThe resignation of Mr. Raffarin comes shortly after the resounding refusal of the ratification of the treaty establishing the European Constitution in a referendum. (See France votes no in EU referendum). While Mr. Raffarin was initially popular with the French citizens (polled at 60% of trust in 2002), he gradually lost support from the population, up to record levels; according to polls, only 22% of the population trust him (including only 2% who trust him strongly).\n\nThe prime minister has responsibility for the day-to-day running of the French government.\n\nThere are questions whether Mr. de Villepin, who has never held elected office and has ascended mostly as a Chirac aide, will be well-received by the population and by the parliamentary majority. His nomination was immediately criticized by left-wing politicians, as well as by the center-right Union for French Democracy, a junior partner in the ruling coalition, as a continuation of the same failed policies; Mr. Villepin was himself criticized as being out-of-touch with respect of the daily needs of the population. The Union for a Popular Movement, the party created for backing Chirac, has now rallied behind Nicolas Sarkozy, whose reciprocal distaste for Chirac and Villepin is well-published.\n\nJacques Chirac announced that Nicolas Sarkozy would be Minister of State (a honorific rank) in the government; it is yet unknown what his attributions will be, but it is rumored that he will become Minister of the Interior, a position whose main function is law enforcement and which he also held from 2002 to 2004. According to polls, Mr. Sarkozy is France's most popular politician. It is also well-known that Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. de Villepin see each other as a hostile competitor, particularly in the perspective of the 2007 presidential election.",

We discussed the unusual leak with them, and the results are published here.\n\nWe asked if Wikileaks was worried about the criminal implications of linking to so much illegal content, but they were not. They said that it was \"politically untenable\" to prosecute them, pointing out that Wikileaks is hosted in many different countries across the globe.\n\nWe asked them if they were \"concerned about the possibility of censorship in the UK, Denmark, Finland etc.?\" \"No,\" Wikileaks told us \"We welcome it.\" Wikinews wondered if this was because of the Streisand effect, but Wikileaks said it was \"because it will demonstrate how censorship systems are abused.\"\n\nWikinews asked Wikileaks why they didn't simply post a list of the sites which they felt were legal and add that all the others contained child porn, but Wikileaks felt \"that would not be a fair representation of the material we obtained.\" After seeking clarification, Wikinews was told \"the question is not what we need to be told. The question is what we need not to be told and who decides. Secret censorship systems are unaccountable and dangerous.\"\n\nWikinews then asked why they didn't leave the full list available, but mark which sites they felt should not be censored. \"We have better things to do,\" was the response given. So how would Wikileaks suggest dealing with child porn?\n\n\"Block financial transactions after due process. It's easy to set up servers. It is not so easy to set up merchant accounts.\" And what would due process be? \"Due process would involve sending a letter to the owner of the merchant account with the accusation and giving them a right to be heard and an appeal process. The banks are politically a lot more powerful than the internet industry so this hasn't happened.\"\n\nAnd should funds in these accounts be seized straight away, or simply frozen until a judge or similar clears their release? \"If the accounts are in-jurisdiction, they should be frozen and released or not at the end of the process. There are plenty of existing mechanisms to do this for drug trafficking, for example.\"\n\nWikileaks then added \"As an analogy, one might argue that everyone should have a loaded gun in the house to protect themselves against home invasions.

The Washington Times reported, on September 23, 2005, that a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that the food was being held at the facility but denied any plans to incinerate the rations donated by Britain.\n\nNevertheless, the move has infuriated aid workers who hasten to point out that \"Under NATO, American soldiers are also entitled to eat such rations, yet the starving of the American South will see them go up in smoke because of FDA red tape madness.\" One aid worker was quoted as saying that \"the world's richest nation couldn't organize a piss-up in a brewery and lets Americans starve while they arrogantly observe petty regulations. Everyone is revolted by the chaotic shambles the US is making of this crisis. Guys from UNICEF are walking around spitting blood.\"\n\nAn FDA spokesman said the rations had not been inspected but were automatically deemed \"unfit for human consumption\" due to Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or colloquially \"mad cow disease\") fears. He observed that 70 pallets of vegetarian MREs were inspected and approved on September 13th. Aid workers claim that, today, BSE is much more of a problem in the U.S. than in Britain.\n\nFood donations from Spain and Italy are also being held by the FDA due to similar concern, as well as thousands of gallons of pear juice from Israel.

The raids were under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 and Arms Act.\n\nThe raids, conducted by over 300 armed police officers, focused on indigenous Māori and environmental activists, including activist Tame Iti. Iti faces eight counts relating to firearms, including having a semi-automatic shotgun and two molotov cocktails. He is well known in New Zealand for many high profile cases, including a sedition charge for shooting the New Zealand flag, for which he was later acquitted, during Waitangi day in 2005.\n\nPolice Commissioner Howard Broad said that those targeted were from various ethnicities and from different motivations.\n\nCommissioner Broad said, \"It was military-style activity they were training for\", adding that he did not believe \"protest activity involves firearms or other weapons.\" One training camp raided by police was \"guerilla-style\" in the Urewera mountain ranges. Guns, ammunition and grenades were found in the camp.\n\nNo one has yet been charged with a crime against the Terrorism Suppression Act, only with charges relating to the Arms Act. \"The Police are proceeding with full care in talking to people and assessing information before we can determine whether there is sufficient evidence to seek the consent of the Attorney General through the Solicitor General to charge anyone under the Terrorism Suppression Act,\" Commissioner Broad said. \"This is the first time that the Terrorism Suppression Act has been considered in terms of an operation.\"\n\nWarrants were executed in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland; the capital, Wellington; Christchurch; Palmerston North and towns in the Eastern Bay of Plenty region. The warrants were issued under the Summary Proceedings Act, which allows searching for evidence of committing an offence against the Terrorism Suppression and Arms acts.\n\nThe police were informed of the existence of the camps by hunters who stumbled across a training operation being conducted by the groups. The raids were undertaken after evidence was gathered during 2006 and 2007 and followed months of police work. Police had infiltrated the camps, and taken video footage of weapons training. Phone and text message communications and conversations between suspects were recorded. Commissioner Broad said, \"Based on the information and the activity known to have taken place, I decided it was prudent that action should be taken in the interests of public safety.\". Reports have indicated a specific threat to the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, was involved.\n\nPrime Minister Helen Clark was briefed on the raids last week by police but refused to comment to reporters earlier today.\n\nThose who have been arrested and appeared in court today were given interim name suppression.",

The editor of Investigate, Ian Wishart, stated that at no time has Investigate ever suggested Davis is gay.\n\nWishart said that he has \"Been targeting Mr Davis for months and has appealed for readers to send him details of his private life. My article makes no homosexual inferences and is merely an attempt to background Davis ahead of reports to follow.\"\n\nInvestigate has been publishing a series of stories involving Davis about an alleged incident overseas. They were tipped off by New Zealand law enforcement. \"The picture is all about trying to find out more about the alleged incident. I am working through overseas sources to investigate the allegations. Regardless of what his investigation uncovers, the results will be published.\" Wishart also says there is more 'dirt' to come.\n\nClark has called it a \"pack of lies\" and labelled it as a smear campaign. \"I've been aware of a smear campaign circulating for many months. Actively circulated by National Party people. And I've had countless friends phone me about it. It's been assiduously spread through circles in business, the law, accountants – it's just come from all quarters.\"\n\nDr. Scott is a close friends of the couple and was, according to Clark, \"reasonably boisterous and drunk,\" when the situation occurred and Davis was \"a bit disgusted,\" when he was kissed. \"We have a particularly small group of very close friends . . . and Ian is right in there. He is one of our oldest friends as a couple. There is not a shred of truth to what Wishart says,\" said Clark.\n\n\"People just fall about themselves laughing when they see that was the great 'gay' allegation,\" Clark said.\n\nClark has partly blamed the Exclusive Brethren for the smear campaign as they were allegedly the ones who campaigned to unseat Labour and also allegations that they hired a private detective to follow Davis, the church has denied having any involvement. Clark has said \"the smear campaign against her husband had spread far too wide for it to be the work of the Brethren alone,\" so she also blames Brash.\n\n\"I think the National Party has stooped to new levels with his leadership. I think we're seeing the absolute desperation of, actually, the far Right in politics, which feels it has a right to rule, couldn't cope with losing three elections in a row and there's a desperation and nastiness about it and it will stoop to anything,\" Clark said.\n\nBrash said that he rejects and condemns the rumour-mongering and a spokesman said: \"he Brash nor any of his MPs were involved in spreading them rumours. National believes the private lives of politicians and their families should be just that – private.\"\n\nA source for the National Party said that people had phoned in with the rumour and National told them to \"go away.\"\n\nGerry Brownlee, Deputy leader of National, denies any National Party involvement. He said: \"Despite Don Brash coming under fire for admitting his marriage was in difficulties amid speculation he had an affair, National is not in a vengeful mode and rejects any such suggestion.

Norris said: \"The leader of a party has to expect their private life to impact on their leadership but in this case it seems Clark does not have a lot to answer to. The story has very little substance.\"\n\nClark has denied that a meeting between Brash to discuss toning down personal attacks will take place.

The police are yet to confirm that they are investigating the claim as of Monday morning.

The suicide has caused much controversy, as some Middle Eastern analysts suggest he may have been executed as a sacrificial lamb.\n\nKanaan had been under investigation two weeks earlier by a United Nations team probing the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri. The assassination of Hariri took place on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to around 1000 kg of TNT were detonated as his motorcade drove past the St. George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told CNN that he was not aware of any evidence suggesting Hariri's death was not suicide. \"If indeed there is a Syrian national implicated in it, he would be considered a traitor and most severely punished,\" the President said.\n\n\"The minister of interior died in his office this afternoon after committing suicide, and the authorities are investigating the incident,\" the SANA report stated. It is reported that the suicide was carried out by shooting himself in the mouth.\n\nEarlier in the day, Kanaan went on Lebanese radio station, Voice of Lebanon, denying that he showed the U.N. investigators cheques paid to him by the late Hariri. Kanaan was Syria's most powerful intelligence chief in Lebanon, which was ruled by Syria until its military withdrawal earlier this year. He returned to Damascus in 2002 as political intelligence chief and joined the cabinet in 2004.\n\nThe UN report on Hariri's assassination is expected to be out at the end of October. The UN investigator, Detlev Mehlis, questioned senior Syrian officials in Damascus during a visit at the end of September. The United States froze Kanaan's assets in the country during July saying he had aided terrorism in Lebanon.\n\nSome parties have suggested that Kanaan's death was arranged to protect others involved in the assassination of Hariri, thus preempting action against others as a result of the pending UN report.\n\n* http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4335698.stm",

All people on board were injured to varying degrees, but most sustained only small cuts and bruises.\n\nAlthough most sources put the toll of injured at 14, some say 16. School officials and the Quebec police agreed that none of the injuries were life-threatening.\n\nThe students were all middle school students from The Wheeler School, a private school in Providence, Rhode Island. The head of the middle school described the students as \"resilient\" and as having \"high spirits\", and said that \"they bounce back really quickly.\".\n\nCouncillors were made available to parents and students.\n\nIt is thought the accident occurred when the driver lost control in a heavy storm. Ann Mathieu, a provincial police spokeswoman, said the weather at the time of the crash \"was very, very rainy and the visibility was not too good.\" She said the crash happened when the bus skidded and the driver swerved to try to keep it on the road, causing it instead to overturn. She also said that charges are unlikely as a result of the incident and that no mechanical problems could be found with the bus.

He claims he had his head was forced back and one of the Blue Men forced the tube in him. The joke is to show footage from the inside of the audience member.\n\nThe Blue Man Group says that nothing actually goes down anyone's throat.\n\n\" 'Esophagus Video' is simply an illusion,\" the group wrote in its press release. \"A camera is held in an actor's hands, the actor's hands are placed near an audience member's mouth (not on or in). The live-feed video screen then switches to a pre-recorded medical video, resulting in the hilarious and absurd illusion that the audience is peering down an individual's esophagus. Because the camera never enters the mouth, the execution of this illusion could not possibly put anyone at risk of injury.\"\n\nThe group added the skit and skits like it have been performed for the past 15 years by them without complaint.\n\nThe Californian is suing on the basis that the alleged tube was unsafely dirty and that his experience being cornered gave him post-traumatic stress and nightmares.\n\nSrodon also claims he lost fillings and dental work because of the tube. The suit is reported to be seeking damages of more than $500,000, however the group reported that they have not been served papers as of Friday morning.\n\nThe Blue Man Group has a lot of audience participation as part of their show and is a Las Vegas fixture. The music and comedy group came to public consciousness around 2000.",

    "original_text": "GambiaThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is calling for the release of seven Gambian journalists arrested for reacting to President Yahya Jammeh's dismissal of an investigation involving the 2004 murder of journalist Deyda Hydara.\n\nThe seven detainees include three members of the Gambian Press Union, two reporters from The Point newspaper and two journalists from Foroyaa newspaper. They were detained on Monday after reprinting a press release that criticized President Jammeh for dismissing an investigation into the unsolved murder of journalist Deyda Hydara.\n\nTom Rhodes is the Africa Program Coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists. He expressed concern that the journalists have still not been released.\n\n\"Neither publication editor should be detained for republishing a press release made by the Gambian Press Union,\" he said. \"The whole point of an independent press is to show all viewpoints and that is a certainly viable one. We call on the NIA National Intelligence Agency officials to release them immediately.\"\n\nVeteran Gambian journalist Deyda Hydara, co-founder of The Point newspaper, was gunned down in 2004. There has been no investigation into the killing but human rights organizations have voiced suspicions that the government was involved.\n\nOn June 8, President Jammeh said in a television interview that he had \"no stake\" in Hydara's death. He hinted that the journalist had a complicated love life that might have resulted in his murder.\n\nRhodes said there are still many unanswered questions on the case.\n\n\"From what we can determine and gather from the Gambian Press Union, there's been absolutely no government investigation into the matter. The one positive thing we can vest from this rather dire situation is that at least the government is reacting to public pressure to respond to these allegations,\" said Rhodes.\n\nGambia has long been criticized for its human rights record and lack of press freedom. In 2006 veteran journalist Ebrima Manneh went missing. Despite repeated pressure from international rights groups, the Gambian government has never released any information about his whereabouts.\n\nRhodes says the latest arrests could trigger a downward spiral.\n\n\"Without journalists on the ground such as those at Foroyaa it's really going to affect what people know of what's going on in the Gambia in the wider picture of human rights,\" said Rhodes.\n\nThe Foroyaa newspaper is petitioning President Jammeh for the release of the detained journalists, including its managing editor Sam Sarr.",

Moussaoui disrupted the proceeding with verbal outbursts directed at the judge.\n\nAppearing before the U.S. District Judge Leonie M. Brinkema at the Albert V. Bryan United States Courthouse, the citizen of France Moussaoui began calmly by saying with a heavy French accent that, \"I want to be heard by this court before the proceedings start.\"\n\nJudge Brinkema warned Moussaoui that it was not the proper time for him to speak. But Moussaoui, 37, who was unrestrained by shackles and wearing a green jump suit labeled with the word \"PRISONER\" across the back, said \"These lawyers are not my lawyers,\" referring to the defense team led by federal public defender Gerald Zerkin. \"Everybody here know that these people do not represent me.\"\n\nThe unsolicited comments prompted the judge to dismiss him. Moussaoui offered no resistance as he was led away by marshals, but shouted over his shoulder to the judge, \"I don't want them to represent. I'm al-Qaida; they are American. They are my enemies.\" He said of the proceeding, \"This trial is a circus.\"\n\nA jury pool of 18 members, six of whom will serve as alternates, will be selected from the group of 500 potential jurors who appeared Monday. Four court sessions were convened that day to begin sorting through the candidates, and Judge Brinkema allowed Moussaoui to return for each of the three remaining sessions. She instructed potential jurors, \"If any of you feel that that outburst or the way he conducted himself might affect the way in which you would go about judging this case, you need to clearly put that statement on the jury questionnaire.\"\n\nThese instructions were repeated to each group of potential jurors after Moussaoui conducted similar outbursts during the remaining sessions, which resulted in his further dismissals.\n\nMoussaoui, in a surprise, pleaded guilty in April to six conspiracy charges of terrorism, leading to yesterday’s start of the jury selection to decide whether he will spend the rest of his life behind bars, or be executed for his involvement in the 9/11 attacks.\n\nMoussaoui was arrested on immigration charges three weeks prior to the attacks. The prosecution contends that he could have prevented the attacks by alerting authorities to the Al-Qaeda plans while he was jailed in Minnesota after his arrest.",

The Air France plane had just entered Indian airspace from Pakistan.

The aircraft, at a flight level of 37,000 feet, had entered Indian airspace on an established border entry point. However, the aircraft was not in communication and also its secondary radar response code (IFF) was not correct and the aircraft identified as 'Unknown',\" IAF officials said.\n\nThe Indian government has increased security along the country's border with Pakistan, following the attacks in Mumbai last year which killed over 170 people.",

The detainees would be relocated to other detention centres. Pontville detention facility, in Pontville, Tasmania, was empty and would also be closed.\n\nThe detention centres staff learned about planned closure of their workplaces from the media rather than the employer directly, United Voice, an Australian trade union, commented. It estimated the number of affected people as 100 workers and \"many more\" casuals and contractors.\n\nIn a statement, Australian Immigration Minister Scott Morrison referred to recent border protection practices to justify the decision. On Tuesday, he told PM radio, \"This Government is taking control of our borders, which enables us to shut mainland detention centres down in Australia. This will save taxpayers around $89 million a year and it's the first down-payment on the dividend of stronger border protection. ... These sites are remote, relatively small and expensive. The savings ... amount to at least $7.4 million a month\". He also noted that the Pontville and Scherger detention facilities would be returned to the Defence Department.\n\nThe local mayor near the Pontville detention centre, Tony Foster, said the centre was opened only three years ago and revived the local economy. Foster also complained about the short notice from the new federal government elected last year. He cited recent centre upgrade costs of $15 million, estimated the number of local small businesses serving the centre between 45 and 48, and said he would explore the option of converting it to a \"corrections facility for 18 to 24 year olds\" with the relevant state and Commonwealth officials.\n\nScott Donaghy, who runs the Brighton's Best Bakehouse business in Brighton, said \"Staff members come in for breakfast, coffee, lunch, having a meeting. Not only were they coming in but there was more money coming into the general area from wages and people living here. I'm disappointed at the fact that another employer is gone from the area.\" A pharmacist-in-charge at Brighton Discount Drug Store also commented, saying that staff members from the detention centre came to Brighton for lunch and shopping.\n\nThe announcement follows controversial reports of wrecked refugee boats found near Indonesian shores by the local police. The refugees had reported being towed back from Australia by the Australian Navy, which had originally deceptively claimed Christmas Island as the refugees' destination.",

Northern Territory has a national high price for hydroponic head (non-leaf) cannabis at AU$30 to 100 for one street deal of approximately 1 ounce.

Drugs other than cannabis, amphetamine, cocaine, and opioids such as heroin had the greatest seizures by weight at 56.8%. The total number of drug related arrests in the 2011&amp;ndash;2012 is the highest in the past decade with over 90,000 total arrests.

    "original_text": "Evangelist Kent Hovind and his wife, Jo, are trying to convince a federal jury that their money from video and amusement park admission sales belong to God and cannot be taxed. The trial began at United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida on Tuesday October 18, 2006 after twelve jury members and two alternates were selected to decide on the 58 federal courts against Hovind and his wife. The trial was expected to take at least two weeks to complete with the prosecution hoping to rest its case Tuesday, but a defense attorney became ill and the Judge delayed the trial until October 30th.\n\nHovind is a Young Earth creationist who does many speaking engagements and debates. He also sells videos giving a pro-creationism perspective, which he receives income for. Hovind, who calls himself \"Dr. Dino\", received a Ph.D in \"Christian education\" from the unaccredited correspondence school Patriot Bible University in 1991.\n\nProsecutor Michelle Heldmeyer said from 1999 to March 2004, the Hovinds took in more than $5 million. Heldmeyer charged Hovind on 12 counts for failing to pay about $470,000 in federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes for his ministry employees between March 31, 2001, and Jan. 31, 2004. Counts 13 through 57 include Hovind's wife for making 45 transactions in a little more than a year, sometimes taking out as much as $9,500 at a time. Banks are required to report cash withdrawals that exceed $10,000.\n\nIn count 58 against Kent includes filing a frivolous lawsuit against the IRS, demanding damages for criminal trespass, filing an injunction against an IRS agent, making threats against investigators and those cooperating with the investigation, and filing false complaints against the IRS for false arrest, excessive use of force and theft.\n\nIn July with his attorney, Public Defender Kafahni Nkrumah, Hovind stated that he did not recognize the government's right to try him on tax-fraud charges.\n\nThis is not the first time Hovind has found himself in legal trouble. In 2002 he refused to get a $50.00 building permit for his Dinosaur Adventure Land, and after three years of legal battles the court ruled that he get a permit or the building would be razed. The park, which depicts dinosaurs as coexisting with humans in the last 6-4,000 years with the more recent \"dinosaurs\" being the Loch Ness monster, is reportedly open after Hovind paid for the permit and fines totaling $10,402.64.\n\nMore directly, M.C. Powe, an IRS officer who investigates people who have unpaid tax returns or unpaid tax liabilities, testified at Hovind's current trial on October, 19, 2006 that she first attempted to collect taxes from the Hovinds in 1996. She noted Hovind tried several \"bullying tactics\" that included suing her at least three times. These resulted in each case being thrown out.\n\nThe Hovind Bankruptcy Decision\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Beard handled Hovind's bankruptcy in 1996 testified on Wednesday that in 1996 after Hovind's vehicles were seized by the IRS, he filed under the Chapter 13 \"wage-earner plan,\" available only to those who have a regular source of income. However, Hovind wrote that he had no form of income, that he rejected his Social Security number and that his employer was God, Beard testified.\n\nIn a 2005 affidavit, the Hovinds argue that Social Security is essentially a \"Ponzi scheme.\" The Hovinds referred to the United States Government as \"the 'bankrupt' corporate government\" and said they were renouncing their United States citizenship and Social Security numbers to become \"a natural citizen of 'America' and a natural sojourner.\"\nKent Hovind 2005 Affidavit\n\nOn Thursday an employee of AmSouth Bank explained that the Currency Transaction Reports requires the bank to report any time a cash amount of $10,000 or more is withdrawn or deposited. This employee noted that various records demonstreated Jo Hovind had made transactions up to $15,000 at a time.\n\nAlso on Thursday Hovind's former neighbor testified regarding Hovind's purchasing of her Palafox Street home. On the stand she said Hovind paid her $30,000 in cash as part of the $155,000 sale.\n\nIn this week's trial two of Hovind's workers testified in federal court that they didn't consider where they worked to be a church. In court Hovind maintains he does not have to pay the taxes because his employees were \"volunteers,\" \"missionaries\" or \"ministers\" and his business was a ministry.\n\nHowever, Brian Popp, Hovind's employee for at least eight years, said he considered himself a minister at the time of his employment, but said Hovind's ministry isn't a church. Popp also testified that Hovind knew about the bank's requirement to report transactions over $10,000 and said it was \"not safe to carry large sums of cash.\"\n\nFurther, Popp said Hovind told his workers not to accept mail addressed to \"KENT HOVIND\" because Hovind told the workers the government created a corporation in his \"all-caps name\" and if the mail was accepted, Hovind claimed, it would be accepting the responsibilities associated with that corporation.\n\nDiane P. Cooksey, served as a sales representative for the ministry from January 2003 to June 2005, and said Hovind expected to pay her own taxes. Cooksey said, \"He explained what his belief was, right up front in the interview, that I would pay my own taxes.\" As told's worker, she received $10 an hour in a weekly paycheck, punched a time clock, was given 10 paid vacation days a year, and considered herself an employee, not a missionary as a few others called themselves.\n\nThe IRS raided Hovind's Dinosaur Adventure Land in April 2004, after which Hovind required his employees to sign nondisclosure agreements. \"I was uncomfortable signing it, I guess, because of not having a full understanding,\" Cooksey said.\n\nRebekah Horton, vice president of the unaccredited Pensacola Christian College, took the stand on the second day of the trial and testified that \"We know the Scriptures do not promote (tax evasion)\". \"It's against Scripture teaching.\"\n\nHorton was given a videotape in the mid 1990s from a woman who worked for Hovind. The video contained \"another evangelist advocating tax evasion,\" Horton explained. The woman who gave the tape to Horton claimed Hovind's philosophy as \"You were giving a gift with your work, and they were giving a gift back to you.\"\n\nPensacola Christian College decided to disallow its students from working with Hovind's Creation Science Evangelism and reported Hovind's scheme to the IRS.\n\nOn Friday, attorney David Charles Gibbs testified that Hovind claimed he had no obligation to pay employee income taxes and explained with \"a great deal of bravado\" how he had \"beat the tax system.\" Gibbs is an attorney with the Gibbs Law Firm, also is affiliated with the Christian Law Association, a nonprofit organization founded by his father that offers free legal help to churches nationwide in a suburb of St. Petersburg, Florida. Gibbs attended the Marcus Pointe Baptist Church when Hovind was a guest speaker at the church on October 17, 2004. Hovind invited Gibbs and others to Hovind's home for pizza and soda.\n\nGibbs testified they talked for many hours, and Hovind \"tried to stress to me that he was like the pope and this was like the Vatican.\" Also Gibbs explained Hovind also told him he preferred to deal in cash because \"dealing with cash there is no way to trace it, so it wasn't taxable.\"\n\nKent E. Hovind, et al. v. Scott M. Schneider et al\n\nLater on Friday, Special IRS Agent Scott Schneider took up the remainder of the day and is expected to resume Monday. Schneider told the jury his investigation revealed that Hovind \"hadn't filed tax returns ever, to my knowledge.\"\n\nHovind tried suing the IRS and Schneider several times to avoid providing information required by the IRS. Each filing was thrown out by the judges.\n\nSchneider's discussed documents seized during the 2004 raid of Hovind's property. These documents, Schneider explained, indicated Hovind ran his ministry as a business with \"meticulous\" payroll documents and a time clock employees had to punch in and out.\n\nIn the raid cash was found \"all over the place.\" Ultimately, $42,000 in cash was seized along with half-dozen guns (including a SKS semiautomatic) at the Hovinds' home.\n\nThe Pensacola News Journal noted that \"in one memo, Jo Hovind informed her daughter, who works at the park, that her pay would be docked $10 for talking too long on the telephone when she should have been working.\"",

Garuda is also considering a bid for defunct rival Linus Airways.\n\nGaruda is expecting the imminent arrival of four new Airbus jets and five new Boeings. The Airbuses, A330-200s, are earmarked to fly international routes to Seoul and Shanghai starting in July. All four have Internet and telephone access for passengers. The Boeings, B737-800 Next Generation aircraft, are due to be in service by the 2010.\n\nAlso planned before the year's end is the increase in flights on the Jakarta-Kuala Lumpur route from one to two per week. \"We saw our current load factors have reached 75 percent and even more during school breaks like June and July,\" Said the company's Vice President for Network Oversight, Risnandi. \"This is very promising.\"\n\nGaruda is now reported to be considering a bid for Linus, who stopped operating on April 27 and have recently been stripped of the rights to fly their former routes as legally required for airlines that do not operate for more than thrity days. Linus still holds some documents of worth to Garuda for transfer to their subisidiary Citilink.\n\n\"I heard that Garuda intends to buy Linus who already hold an aviation business license (SIUP) and an air operators certificate (AOC) for the scheduled air services,\" said Indonesian Director General of Civil aviation Herry Bakti S. Gumay to reporters for Bisnis Indonesia. He said that his office was in favour of a takeover by Garuda because foreign bids are limited to holding a maximum total of 49% of the shares in Linus.\n\nLinus Airways' President Directer Indra said that \"we are flexible to acquisition, depending on the investor. If someone wants to buy 100% of the shares we can release our shares, but if someone wants take only a majority shareholding with us as a partner – we are also open.\" Indra commented that he has had an informal meeting with Garuda CEO Emirsyah Satar but says that they never discussed acquisition by Garuda and that Linus is already in talks with another 'strategic investor' with a view to resuming operations.\n\nTwo airlines, Riau Airlines and Kartika Airlines, have both launched bids for the ten routes formally operated by Linus, which include four from Jakarta and three from Batam.\n\nGaruda Indonesia's Financial Direcotr Eddy Purwanto has anounced that US$650 million worth of loans from Bank Mandiri have been restructured. Garuda, who has apointed Rothschild's as their international financial advisors, will now pay US$450 million by 2015.",

According to a report by USA Today, responding to the commercial's launch, Wikipedia users vandalized the article, with statements like \"The 'Whopper' is the worst hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King,\" or that it contains \"rat and toenail clippings\", all of which would be recited by the speaker.\n\nAmidst the spree of edits to the article, a Wikipedia user named \"Fermachado123\" edited the page to reflect positively on the burger. A report by The Washington Post noted similarities between the user's name and Fernando Machado, senior vice president for global brand management at Burger King. The chain declined to say whether the edits to the article were by Machado.\n\nThe commercial subsequently prompted responses from Wikipedia and Google, with the former locking its article from editing by unregistered users, and the latter preventing its speakers from responding to the commercial. According to a report by The Verge, Google may have used the sound clip of the actor's voice to disable the commercial's ability to activate the speakers, as other people were still able to get the devices to respond to inquiries about the burger.\n\nBurger King later bypassed Google's restrictions on its commercial, by releasing new versions of the spot. The chain revealed the new versions on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel Live on Wednesday night. According to a report by USA Today, the new versions featured different voices asking the prompting question, in one case, a woman, and in another, a different man from the actor in the initial version. Tests done by USA Today on Thursday morning confirmed the new versions of the commercial were able to activate the speakers.\n\nBefore airing the new commercials, Burger King expressed awareness the original spot no longer triggered the speakers, and teased the subsequent versions through a statement on Wednesday by spokesman Brooke Scher Morgan. \"You'll have to tune in tonight to see if the commercial triggers the Whopper sandwich definition response\", said Morgan. According to Morgan, the chain launched the commercial as a means to \"do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices.\"\n\nIn a post on Twitter dated to Wednesday, software developer Anthony Kirkpatrick criticized Burger King's approach, writing, \"re: that burger king ad, yeah relying on linking to wiki text through an assistant definitely can't go wrong or be misused in any way\".\n\nAnother tweet, by user Dawn Xiana Moon, dated to Thursday stated, \"Burger King fail. Hijacking devices isn't cool. It's clever, but it's not going to win friends.\"\n\nUsers on YouTube also took the commercial's comments page on the site to vent their frustration with the approach taken by Burger King, citing concerns regarding privacy incursions through the remote activation of the speakers. \"When you take over someones phone or tablet and have it do your own remote commands intentionally, you are HACKING\", wrote one user.\n\nAccording to marketing professor Jonah Berger, a faculty member of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, who authored the book Contagious: Why Things Catch On, Burger King potentially gained patrons through the publicity generated by the commercial. \"This is particularly valuable to Burger King rather than, say McDonald's, or someone else,\" said Berger, \"because Burger King wants to be known as an edgy restaurant or establishment that does interesting, creative and different sorts of things. It's part of their brand equity\". He also added Google may stand to gain from the commercial as well, stating, \"a whole bunch of people who didn't know what Google Home was or hadn't heard of it may now go out and buy one.\"\n\nPrior to the release of the commercial, Google caused a similar incident during the Super Bowl, when its own commercials activated the speakers because they contained the \"Ok Google\" trigger phrase. On the possibility other advertisers may attempt to repeat Burger King's actions, Berger had this to say: \"Just like any other marketing campaign, the first time someone tries something, it's creative, innovative and everyone says it's great... But two weeks from now, if every brand is doing this with every ad, people are going to start getting pretty annoyed.\"\n\nIn a statement by e-mail on Thursday, Dara Schopp, a spokeswoman for Burger King, indicated the commercial resulted in a 300% increase in Twitter \"social conversation\" on Burger King, in comparison to statistics from the previous day.\n\nWhilst Google declined to comment to The Washington Post on the question, they reported an individual unofficially indicated the company was not consulted by Burger King prior to the launch of the commercial.",

    "original_text": "Sudan\nThe African Union (AU) has decided it will not act on an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Beshir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for allegedly perpetrating war crimes in Darfur.\n\nJean Ping, the AU's current chairperson, said of the decision by the 53 member states \"They are showing to the world community that if you don't want to listen to the continent, if you don't want to take into account our proposals... if you don't want to listen to the continent, as usual, we also are going to act unilaterally.\"\n\nThirty African states have ratified the ICC treaty. Libya in particular had pressed for the decision, with leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, who hosted the summit, going so far as to invite controversial Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to address the summit; the Iranians agreed but later canceled the visit.\n\nA Human Rights Watch spokesman said \"This resolution, the result of unprecedented bullying by Libya, puts the AU on the side of a dictator accused of mass murder rather than on the side of his victims, but it cannot erase the legal obligations undertaken by the 30 African countries which have ratified the ICC treaty.\"\n\nThis treaty requires signatory states — which al-Beshir has avoided since the March issuing of the arrant — to arrest any suspects within their borders. Sudan's foreign ministry commented that now \"The president is free to travel anywhere in Africa, including those countries that have ratified the ICC's Rome statute.\"\n\nAmnesty International also criticised the new resolution, with Amnesty Africa's director Erwin van der Borght saying \"This decision by the African Union member states shows a disdain for those in Darfur who suffered gross human rights violation and makes a mockery of the AU as an international body. By supporting a wanted person accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, it undermines the credibility of states which are party to the Rome Statute and the AU as a whole.\"\n\nThe Sudanese foreign ministry said that \"We think that Africa is now one front against the ICC ... Most Africans believe it is a court that has been set up against Africa and the third world.\"\n\nSudan's government has estimated 10,000 people have died as a result of violence in Darfur since February 2003, while the United Nations (UN) puts the figures as 300,000 dead with 2.7 million having fled their homes. The UN Security Council was criticised by the AU for its refusal to consider suspending al-Beshir's warrant for one year, which Africa said could have helped efforts seeking peace in Darfur.",

The fines were imposed by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) following an investigation lasting seven years. It is the largest penalty ever issued by the OFT for breaches of the 1998 Competition Act, with the case involving two major tobacco makers and numerous British supermarkets.\n\nTogether the manufacturers involved, Imperial Tobacco (whose brands include Golden Virginia and Lambert &amp; Butler) and Gallaher Group (who own Silk Cut and Benson &amp; Hedges among others) make almost 90% of all cigarettes and roll-ups sold in the UK. They were fined £112 million and £50 million respectively.\n\nThe supermarkets facing the largest penalties were Asda and The Co-operative Group, at £14 million each. Other stores fined were First Quench, Morrisons, Safeway, Shell garages, Somerfield, T&amp;S Stores (now One Stop) and TM Retail. Also taking part in the price fixing were Sainsbury's, though they received immunity from being fined after alerting the OFT and co-operating with the investigation. Some of the other companies also earned reductions in their fines through co-operation with the OFT.\n\nSimilar allegations against Tesco were not pursued due to a lack of evidence.\n\nImperial Tobacco denied the charges, claiming in a statement that its dealings with the retailers were simply legitimate \"promotional arrangements\". They have said they are considering an appeal against the decision.\n\nIn a press release the OFT said that the fines would send out a strong message. \"Practices such as these, which restrict the ability of retailers to set their resale prices for competing brands independently, are unlawful.\" said Simon Williams, OFT Senior Director of Goods. \"They can lead to reduced competition and ultimately disadvantage consumers.\"\n\n\"This enforcement action will send out a strong message that such practices, which could in principle be applied to the sale of many different products, can result in substantial penalties for those who engage in them.\"",

    "original_text": "Hundreds of thousands of Turks rallied again in Turkey's largest city, Istanbul on Sunday to protest Abdullah Gül's presidential candidacy, which they fear would threaten Turkey's separation between religious and state affairs.\n\nThe \"Çağlayan Demonstration for the Republic\" was centered around the Çağlayan Square. While security forces estimated the number of demonstrators at 700 000, estimates around 1 million and more are reported in the Turkish media.\n\nThe scene of the previous \"Protect your Republic\" demonstration in Turkey's capital Ankara was repeated, with uncountable Turkish flags and many posters of Atatürk, founder of the modern Turkish state. The protesters shouted slogans like: \"Turkey is secular and will remain secular!\".\n\nThe demonstrators fear that current Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül, the presidential candidate of the ruling AK Party of Prime Minister Erdoğan, will allow Islamic influences in Turkey to become more powerful. The party officially denies having such a hidden agenda.\n\nThe army, traditionally loyal to the Turkish pro-secular side, accused the government on Friday of tolerating radical Islam. But Gül replied: \"It is out of the question to withdraw my candidacy.\" In 1997 the democratically elected Islamic-oriented President Necmettin Erbakan was removed from office by the army, with public support.\n\nIn Turkey, the president is elected directly by the parliament, and Gül failed to get elected in the first round of the elections, when opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote. The opposition also appealed to the Constitutional Court to declare the process unlawful. A second round is to be held on Wednesday, and a third one on May 9.\n\nGül's wife Hayrunisa wears a head scarf and has appealed to the European Court of Human Rights to be allowed to wear it at a university. But secular Turks want to keep the current ban on wearing such scarves in public places.\n\nPrime Minister Erdoğan in a national television address on Monday called for national unity: \"Unity, togetherness, solidarity, these are the things we need most. We can overcome many problems so long as we treat each other with love.\"\n\n\"Even four and a half years ago, this country was riven by serious problems, which thank goodness have been overcome one by one,\" the Prime Minister said, referring to the many reforms his government has implemented since it came into power. He also pointed out Turkey's steady growth rate during the last years. To maintain this, he asked the nation for stability: \"At this point, it's enough that we protect the environment of stability, it's enough that we protect the environment of peace. Enough that we don't harm the environment of confidence we have worked so hard to attain.\"\n\nIn reaction to the ongoing uncertainty, the E.U. enlargement commissioner warned the Turkish Army about interfering: “It is important that the military leaves the remit of democracy to the democratically-elected government and this is the test case if the Turkish armed forces respect democratic secularism and the democratic arrangement of civil-military relations,” commissioner Olli Rehn said. Erdoğan and Gül support Turkey's efforts to join the European Union.\n\nThe Turkish stock market lost 4,01 per cent on Monday, which analysts attribute to the current political crisis.",

It also accuses him of possession and trafficking of more than 5 kilograms of cocaine.\"\n\nThe elder Gotti — who died in prison in 2002 at age 61 — was convicted for ordering the killing of DiBono, among other crimes.\n\nA second indictment charges Gotti's associates.

The New York Times reports that Gotti will be taken to Tampa, Florida arraignment in United States District Court, where Tuesday's news conference was held.\n\nThe younger Gotti pleaded guilty to racketeering charges including bribery, extortion, gambling and fraud in 1999. He was sentenced to 77 months in prison and was released in 2005 with credit for good behavior.\n\nSince then Gotti was tried three times over an alleged plot to kidnap Guardian Angels founder and radio personality Curtis Sliwa. Trials in September of 2005 and in March and September of 2006 each resulted in hung juries. Prosecutors said they believed Gotti to be guilty, but lacking fresh evidence, they decided to no longer pursue the case.\n\n\"I can't wait for the day until he gets three hots and a cot and I'll pay for that expense,\" Sliwa told ABC News. \"The third time that he walked out, he gave me a sly grin as he was able to go home to his family in Oyster Bay, his Ponderosa. But I swore then that until the ends of time that until he goes to hell without an asbestos suit that I'd see him in court again and that wish has come true.\"\n\n\"They tried very hard to convict him up here. They spared no resources and it didn't work,\" Charles Carnesi, Gotti's attorney told the Associated Press. \"It's tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this. It's almost laughable.\"\n\nAnother lawyer for Gotti, Seth Ginsberg told the New York Times that \"We’re confident that there is no strength to the allegations and that he will prevail once again.\"",

Labwani founded the Democratic Liberal Gathering, which Human Rights Watch describes as \"a group of Syrian intellectuals and activists who advocate for peaceful change in Syria based on democratic reforms, liberalism, secularism and respect for human rights.\"\n\n\"The Syrian government has accelerated its crackdown on free speech and peaceful activism,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \"Peaceful activists like Labwani are paying a heavy price for expressing their views.\"\n\nLabwani was convicted of inciting a foreign country to attack Syria. The charges may have stemmed from meetings Labwani held in late 2005 with American officials while on a visit to the United States. He was arrested at Damascus Airport on his return to Syria in November 2005.\n\nThe White House issued a statement on Friday condemning the sentence, and suggested that Labwani may have been treated harshly under inhumane prison conditions. \"These developments demonstrate that the Asad regime in Syria continues to suppress dissent and crack down on those who peacefully seek to defend their rights and bring democratic reform to their country,\" said Tony Snow, White House Press Secretary. \"As the President stated last year, all political prisoners in Syria should be released immediately.\"\n\nThe sentencing of Labwani comes just two weeks after Anwar al-Bunni, another Syrian democracy activist was jailed five years for signing a petition, the \"Damascus Declaration\", which encouraged significant changes to Syria's involvement with Lebanon.\n\nLabwani's defense lawyer, Khalil Maatouk, rejected the charges against his client and indicated he would appeal the judgment within 30 days. \"This is a political trial,\" said Maatouk.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said that Cairo was working with Iraqi authorities to advance the release of Mr. Al-Sherif, who was kidnapped on Saturday.\n\nA search of insurgent hideouts conducted by Iraqi and U.S. forces began on Monday in western parts of Baghdad.\n\nAbul Gheit pledged that everyone involved \"handle the situation wisely\".\n\n\"Our colleague... went to Iraq to serve the interests of the Iraqi people. We hope that they try their best in locating him and that he returns safely to his family,\" he said while in Libya for an African Union summit.\n\n\"We understand the fury of the Iraqi people but this man is working for the benefit of the Iraqi and the Egyptian people and therefore we wish that he is treated accordingly.\"\n\nAn unidentified source said Mr Al-Sherif was \"buying a newspaper\" when he was kidnapped last Saturday. Witnesses said that a gunman \"hit him on the head with a pistol as others shouted that he was 'an American spy'\". He was then pushed into one of two BMWs used in the kidnapping. More than 36 hours afterwards no group have claimed responsibility or made any demands.\n\nEgyptians in Iraq are no strangers to kidnappings. Last July, rebels kidnapped Egyptian diplomat Mohamed Mamdouh Qutb, who was freed unharmed. The gunmen from this case released a statement saying that their actions were in response to Egypt offering to train Iraq's security forces, an offer that was later withdrawn.\n\nMr. Al-Sherif arrived in Iraq on June 1, shortly before his promotion to the position of ambassador &amp;mdash; a move that was praised by Iraq's foreign minister. The Egyptian government upgraded its relations with Iraq in mid-June to \"full embassy status\".\n\nSome believe the U.S. is \"urging\" Arab states to appoint ambassadors in order to \"support the new government and curb the resistance.\" Egypt had withdrawn its ambassador to Iraq 14 years ago, and was in support of the first gulf war in 1991.",

    "original_text": "Economy and business\nThe International Labor Organization (ILO), a branch of the United Nations concerned with labor and workers' rights issues, issued a report Wednesday explaining how the global economic crisis could create a global employment crisis by the end of the year.\n\n\"By the end of 2008 working poverty, vulnerable employment and unemployment were beginning to rise as the effects of the slowdown spread,\" the report states. \"If the recession deepens in 2009, as many forecasters expect, the global jobs crisis will worsen sharply.\" Even for those who keep their jobs, the report predicts that \"earnings and other conditions of employment will deteriorate.\"\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, the ILO says 51 million jobs could be lost in 2009, meaning that 7.1% of the world's working population would be out of a job. In a more realistic scenario, the report foresees a loss of 30 million jobs, with a global unemployment rate of 6.5%. The unemployment rate has increased in recent years, from 5.7% in 2007 to an estimated 6% in 2008.\n\nEven the report's most optimistic scenario for this year, a loss of 18 million jobs at an unemployment rate of 6.1%, is not much different than the ILO's October 2008 prediction of 20 million jobs lost this year due to the financial crisis.\n\nThe report warns that developing countries in South Asia and Subsaharan Africa will be harshly affected by the economic crisis. Although working poverty - defined as having daily wages of US$2 or less - is on an overall decline, these regions are still characterized by poor working conditions, low salaries, and an insecure job market. This will only worsen in 2009, according to the ILO.\n\n\"Taking into account that a wage and salary job in poor regions may still not ensure all the components of a decent job, it becomes understandable that only a minority of working people have a job that is well paid, respects their fundamental rights and ensures some security in case of job loss, personal or family illnesses, or other difficulties.\" The report says that by the end of 2008, nearly 53% of workers around the world could be in \"vulnerable employment\".\n\nIn terms of actual unemployment, however, developed countries are the ones most likely to be affected by the downturn, as they are more tied to the global financial system. The unemployment rate in the European Union and other developed economies increased by 0.7 percentage points in 2008, the largest increase of all regions. \"Globalization combined with rapid technological advances is another challenge for labour markets in the region,\" the ILO says. \"It is important for workers and employers to be ready and able to adjust quickly to change and to stiffer competition.\"\nInternational Labor Organization\nStill, the unemployment rate of 6.4% in these developed countries is far less than in North Africa and the Middle East, which had unemployment rates of 10.3% and 9.4% respectively. East Asia had the lowest unemployment rate of the regions at 3.8%.\nAre you worried about the findings of this latest report?\nThe report urged global economies to take cooperative measures, including working with the United Nations, in order to stem the economic crisis. It also asks governments to address the \"negative social consequences of globalization\" by placing on emphasis an social justice-based programs targeted toward women, youth, and other \"vulnerable groups\".\n\nIn particular, the ILO says governments should establish public infrastructure projects such as road construction, expand health insurance and unemployment benefits, and focus on the creation of green jobs when devising their stimulus plans. \"When governments design fiscal stimulus packages, it is important that they consider employment-related goals, including explicit employment growth targets,\" the report concluded.\n\n\"In the world, there remains a huge untapped labour potential, and economic growth and development could be much higher if everyone was given the chance of a decent job.\"",

    "original_text": "Satellite Information Services Limited (SIS), the racecourse television company part-owned by William Hill (19%) and Ladbrokes (23%), has been named by the BBC as the preferred bidder for its Outside Broadcasts division, one of three active businesses within BBC Resources Ltd. Other SIS shareholders include, Thales (Racal) (23%), United Business Media (19%), Racecourse Association (10%) and the Tote (6% - all figures rounded).\n\nSIS Chief Executive David Holdgate would not comment on the terms of the deal, thought to be between £20m and £50m, but said it would be \"an ideal acquisition for SIS\" and \"a perfect fit with our existing SISLink and sports coverage\". The company has long-term contracts with other leading broadcasters, such as Sky and ITV and provides satellite links for live sport and news.\n\nIn a statement, the BBC said that it intended to exchange contracts and transfer the Outside Broadcasts business and around 300 staff in the near future, with Andrew Thornton, BBC project director for the sale of the division, saying that \"SIS offered the BBC a good deal and best value for licence fee payers\". Mark Tugwell, Director, BBC Outside Broadcasts, added \"it's time for our business to flourish under new ownership, without the constraints of BBC ownership\".\n\nThe transfer would mean that SIS will be covering major sporting events including the Beijing Olympics for the BBC in August 2008.\n\nThe division — part of the BBC's commercial subsidiary, BBC Resources Ltd — owns a fleet of 15 television production units plus sound, support and communications vehicles (making a total fleet of over 90) and is based in self-contained premises in Langley, three miles north-west of Heathrow. These units cover events ranging from music festivals and state occasions, to Wimbledon and World Cup football.\n\nOn 7th March 2008 the surprise announcement was made that the studio operation — employing around 350 staff at Television Centre and Elstree — would be \"retained by the Corporation as a commercial business\" after failing to find a buyer.\n\nThe fate of this third business has yet to be announced with the BBC continuing negotiations with the preferred bidder \"understood to be a company based in west London\".\n\nWas not included in the privatisation — in early October 2007 it was announced that the business was to close within six months and the entire stock sold as a complete collection. The sale fell through, and on 14th February 2008 the department ceased trading, with a BBC spokeswoman adding that \"the arrangements the corporation was pursuing have not worked out and BBC Resources is currently inviting interested parties to consider making an offer to purchase.\"\n\nBBC Costume and Wigs — which had been trading as part of BBC Studios — was the second largest collection of its kind in the UK, after the leading suppliers Angels The Costumiers.\n\nThe Resources business-to-business unit was formed in 1998 and operates television studios, post-production and outside broadcast facilities for it's parent share-holding company, the BBC. It does not own any studios or premises, its assets being equipment and staff (approximately 960 plus 165 administration staff).\n\nAdvertised for sale on 16th August 2007 in the Financial Times, The Times and Broadcast and in 2006-07 making profits of £5.2 million with a revenue of £126 million, the disposal — led by Ernst &amp; Young — invited expressions of interest for the whole division or for each of its three operations separately. The BBC has yet to release the name of the preferred bidder for BBC Post Production.\n\nBBC Resources was the first of the BBC's commercial business-to-business divisions to be set up as a limited company and is the last to be sold, the BBC having previously divested itself of BBC Technology and BBC Broadcast. BBC Enterprises, now known as BBC Worldwide, remained in-house as now does BBC Studios.\n\nIt had been intended to float Resources back in 2005, but this was postponed for two years following strike action and ACAS talks in June 2005 — the BBC giving an undertaking that there would be no preparations made to sell the company until January 2007, and no sale allowed before July 2007. It had been hoped to dispose of all three divisions by the end of this month.",

    "original_text": "The future direction of Kelso High School has become a little clearer following an announcement by the New South Wales government that the school will be rebuilt on it's former site as a year 7 to 12 secondary school.\n\nThe original school built in 1978 was destroyed by fire on August 18, 2005. The cause of the fire remains a mystery. Following the fire, students were receiving lessons at a number of locations around Bathurst, but have since returned to the Kelso High School site where they are housed in demountable buildings on the school's oval. The ruins of the former school lay behind.\n\nA report made following a series of community meetings into the replacement of the school earlier this month said that the community wished for Kelso High School to be rebuilt at its former site as a secondary school. The report also said that the community wished for Kelso and Bathurst High Schools to pool HSC resources by sharing subjects and allowing years 11 and 12 students to study across both campuses.\n\nA number of models were proposed at the meetings. These included:\n*Rebuilding Kelso High School as a senior high school only (years 10 through 12) near Charles Sturt University and Bathurst TAFE. Under this plan Bathurst High School would cater for years 7 to 9.\n*Rebuilding Kelso High School as a middle school from years 6 to 9.\n*Rebuild Kelso High School as both a primary and secondary school, incorporating Kelso Public School.\n*Rebuilding Kelso High School as it was on it's former site.\n\nThe proposal to rebuild Kelso High School as a secondary school and share HSC resources with Bathurst High School was made at the community meetings. Under this system, both schools will have separate principals and identities with a college director co-ordinating HSC activities between the two campuses. If one school does not offer a subject the student is interested in they will be able to take that subject at the other campus.",

    "original_text": "A major winter storm, which has been nicknamed by some as \"Snowmageddon\", has pummeled parts of the U.S. Middle Atlantic region, dumping up to 19 inches (50 centimeters) of snow in some parts of the Washington area.\n\nThe National Weather Service is predicting as much as 24 to 30 inches (60 to 75 cm) of snow for the Washington, D.C. region by late Saturday. The storm brought high winds and low visibility, with winds gusting at 56 miles per hour (93 kilometers per hour) along the coast.\n\nLife in the nation's capital ground to a halt with the federal government and most businesses closing early on Friday and residents warned to stay off the snow-clogged roads. Hundreds of thousands of homes were without power as the wet snow weighed heavily on trees and power lines. Power lines in some areas have been brought down by the heavy snow.\n\nThe Weather Service issued blizzard and winter storm warnings for states reaching from Virginia and West Virginia up to Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey.\n\nForecasters say this could be the largest recorded snowfall in Washington, rivaling a storm, known as the Knickerbocker Storm, that hit the city nearly 90 years ago, in January 1922. The largest amount of snowfall recorded so far has been in Elkridge, Maryland, reporting 32 inches (81 cm). The 1922 storm was named the Knickerbocker Storm for a theater where 98 people were killed when the building's roof collapsed due to heavy snow. Snowfall in that storm measured 28 inches (71 cm).\n\nAirlines and airports across the region have canceled flights and train service has been disrupted. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport suspended flight operations for the day while nearby Washington Dulles International Airport reported only a few international flights would be departing. Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport reported most flights were canceled. Flights at Philadelphia International Airport are also canceled.\n\nAmtrak announced that it was canceling a number of trains between Washington and New York City, along with service from Washington to cities in the south. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, known as the Metro locally, has suspended bus service and above ground train service. Underground subway service is running at 30 minute intervals.\n\nAs the storm approached, residents emptied supermarket shelves, stocking up on food and other supplies, especially due to Super Bowl XLIV which will be held on Sunday. Local area sports teams in Washington, D.C. will still play games as scheduled. People are urged to take the Metro to see the games and not use the roads. Impromptu snowball fights have also broken with some people going as far as to organize them over Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe winter weather has already been blamed for hundreds of road accidents. So far two fatalities have been reported, a father and son who were rendering aid to a stranded motorist on Interstate 81 in Virginia, when an approaching tractor-trailer jackknifed and killed the pair.\n\nThis is the second major snowstorm to hit the region in less than two months.\n\nAgnosticPreachersKid\n\nCategory:North American blizzard of 2010",

    "original_text": "Wikinews extended invitations by e-mail on March 23 to multiple candidates running in the Texas' 6th congressional district special election of May 1 to fill a vacancy left upon the death of Republican congressman Ron Wright. Of them, the office of Democrat Daryl Eddings, Sr. agreed to answer some questions by phone March 30 about their campaigns and policies. The following is the interview with Ms Chatham on behalf of Mr Eddings, Sr.\n\nEddings is a federal law enforcement officer and senior non-commissioned officer in the US military. His experience as operations officer of an aviation unit in the California National Guard includes working in Los Angeles to control riots sparked by the O. J. Simpson murder case and the police handling of Rodney King, working with drug interdiction teams in Panama and Central America and fighting in the Middle East. He is the founder of Operation Battle Buddy, which has under his leadership kept in touch with over 20 thousand veterans and their families. He was born in California, but moved to Midlothian, Texas. He endeavours to bring \"good government, not no government\". Campaign manager Faith Chatham spoke to Wikinews on matters ranging from healthcare to housing.\n\nAn Inside Elections poll published on March 18 shows Republican candidate Susan Wright, the widow of Ron Wright, is ahead by 21% followed by Democrat Jana Sanchez with 17% and Republican Jake Ellzey with 8% with a 4.6% margin of error among 450 likely voters. The district is considered \"lean Republican\" by Inside Elections and voted 51% in favour of Donald Trump in last year's US presidential election. This is down from 54% for Trump in 2016's presidential election, the same poll stated.\n\nWNI first question Could you please introduce Mr Eddings and his history more broadly?\n\nFaith Chatham Okay. Daryl J. Eddings Sr is a retired senior non-commissioned officer. He has 26 years of military experience, and then part of that time he was also working for the US federal government. So, he had 30 years of federal law enforcement experience, and he's only 60 so that's pretty incredible. He's a highly decorated veteran; A news story can mention the medals including the purple heart but for advert purposes a campaign cannot mention them without prior approval of the Pentagon. We are instructed to refer to his decoration as \"highly decorated senior non commissioned officer retired\"., but if you look at his uniform, there's not even a place to put another medal! Just about anything you could give him from a Purple Heart, he has earned. He lives in Midlothian, Texas. His family ties, his dad's family, goes back six generations, but he says by an accident of birth he was born in California. So, he graduated from high school in California and went immediately into the military. And then, when he came out of the military, he became a single father and so he went back to California where his children were. And went into the National Guard in California and, at the same time he went to work for the US federal service. So, with the US federal service he was the non-commissioned officer, operations officer, on the back &amp;mdash; he wasn't the commander of the plane, but he was the person that was in-command of everybody on the plane with US national service.\n\nSo he had fourteen deputies under him, and then he was supervising people on three different federal agencies. He basically, I found he'll say \"oh, I was in the military\" and then when I peel it down and I peel it down it's so much more complex. There is a time he basically went back to California thinking he'd be closer to his kids, but that was during the George Bush years. And if you remember what happened to people who go into the National Guard during that period of time, he was deported more during that period of time than otherwise. He was sent to Panama on drug interdiction, he patrolled the US southern border on drug interdiction and he was the operations commander for emergency management with the state of California while he was there.\n\nHe was the senior non-commissioned officer reporting to a one-star general during the Rodney King riot, the O. J. Simpson riot, earthquakes, forest fires. He supervised an aviation unit that flew to this big state, you know, surveying it for wars, he was responsible for moving troops and equipment and people and personnel. And also his team was directly responsible for the security of the governor and the mayor and their staff during the O. J. Simpson and the Rodney King riots. So, he has an incredibly wide range of experience.\n\nIn his foreign deployments, and he's been deployed all over the world, he was the provost marshal in Iraq, and there was a tactical team that was under his command that was looking for the top generals of the Revolutionary Guard, you know, right after Saddam Hussein and you know, that kind of stuff. He was being a provost marshal, it was the equivalent of being the police chief over a city of 50 thousand and a 75 mile (121 kilometre) radius. So, he's always been the person that was responsible for the people above him and below him. He's always been the person that they went to to find solutions. Whatever was needed, he was the one that was supposed to figure out how to get it and how to take care of it, and this is what he continues to do.\n\nWN What would he consider the powers of the US representative?\n\nFaith Chatham The power of the US representative, in his thing, is the ability to deliver for the people what they need. He thinks that what most people are doing is not really, you know, that's not really; it upsets him to see so many of our representatives representing a very small number of people instead of really looking out for the majority of the people. He takes very seriously; he decided to run, he'd been thinking about it for a long time but he made up his mind January 6, because he doesn't believe that there are, he believes that there are too many in Congress that don't understand what their oath of office is. They don't understand that their loyalty is to the Constitution of the United States, not to any one person or a party.\n\nHe knows that there were too many of them up there that are applauding what Donald Trump did, and are saying that it was just a demonstration, or it was just a riot. And he's been in riots; he knows what a riot is and he knows this was an anchor=Noun. He believes very truthfully that one of the greatest powers that we have is the power to vote, and this was an attempt to abridge the right of people to vote. And so, a person that's in Congress is a representative of the people that have elected them. And that's the power: the people are the power. We've lost it, it's been lost because of dark money and gerrymandering and many things in that area. And there's many attempts right now to abridge the vote even further. And so, he really feels like that we have got to regain more of the seats so that we can protect what he and his friends have fought so hard and given so much to give us, you know.\n\nSo, that's, I guess that's about as good of an answer I know I can give for him. We've been through this stuff so much now, I've almost got to memorise it.\n\nWN Alright. He's running as a Democrat in a house district which is controlled by Republicans since...\n\nFaith Chatham He is a life-long Democrat, he's been very active in the Democratic Party; he was the chief of staff and the security officer for Dr Shirley McKellar who ran three times against Louie Gohmert down in East Texas, and he helped to organise East Texas, and he was very much in favour of Hillary Clinton, and so he was working to try to help, you know get out the vote for Hillary during those years that we was working down there. And he's participated in the state convention and in the national conventions for the Democratic Party.\n\nWN Alright, well, my question was he's running as a Democrat in a house district which has been controlled by Republicans since 1983, it's being contested by the Republicans and the Libertarians and an independent. Why do you think Texans would choose a Democrat this time?\n\nFaith Chatham This district has been going purple. In 2014, we made a turn in that district. In fact, the Tarrant County &amp;mdash; Tarrant County is the largest part of the district, and it is now purple. The two smaller, in fact the last three elections the Democrats would have won if it hadn't been for the Republicans in the small rural counties of Navarro and Ellis. He lives in Midlothian, and that's the part of the county that is &amp;mdash; Ellis County &amp;mdash; that's been turning blue, and he has a lot of support in that part. And the Democrats that are running are not running against each other; they're running together. And they're not in there attacking each other, they're basically running together, and so the district has been turning steadily blue. There's enough people that are, there's been, you know, it's a matter of building infrastructure. You build political infrastructure year after year after year, and I believe they really began building that political infrastructure in 2012 in that district, and it's been by certain, it's been by candidates that have run and lost, but they have put certain things in place that the next one can deal with. And so, there's a possibility. It's not a done deal.\n\nBut this district, in case you remember, this is a district that Phil Gramm; Phil Gramm was a Republican who went to work for &amp;mdash; he lost, he ran for Congress as a Republican and lost, he went to work for a Democrat. Then, he ran as a Democrat and won, and then he immediately went in and partnered with Ronald Reagan to get trickle-down economics passed. And, he made Tip O'Neill mad, and he pulled him off of all of his committees, and he took his marbles and became a Republican, it's been Republican ever since. Trickle-down economics has not worked in that district. The district, especially the two rural counties have got poorer and poorer ever since that happened, and one of the things that really caused that is that trickle-down economics and also the GOP tax cuts that had no-strings-attached meant that companies no longer invested in employees' education and training. They no longer had to invest in upgrading their infrastructure, on upgrading their own ... on investing here in America. We lost American jobs, and Ellis and Navarro counties are two counties where they really have lost a lot of jobs. And, there's been a lot of things that have happened in that district: the housing costs have gone up rapidly, they have less access to healthcare.\n\nSo, there's been a real price. Now, there's also Joe Barton, who was of course Phil Gramm's anchor=Noun, and Ron Wright was Joe Barton's chief of staff during a large part of the time that Joe was on the Energy Committee. And the main thing Joe did was protect the energy companies. And here in January, we had a very bad storm here, and the protection that had been given to the energy companies really meant that a lot of Texans really lost their life, and many others basically lost, you know, were out in the cold literally; because they didn't force them to winterise, they set up a scheme to where if they didn't produce the energy &amp;mdash; if you don't deliver energy you can profiteer and charge much higher rates.\n\nSo, some people are waking up on this. There's also, there are people that are very staunch, this particular race in particular, you have a real divide between those that are all for Donald Trump and those that aren't. All twelve of the Republicans voted for Donald Trump in November. There's only one out of the twelve that says he no longer deserves to be the leader of the party because of January 6. So, you have a real agreement on Trump's policies, and you also have a great many of them that really believe that the insurrection was just right, you know it was just fine and dandy. There are a lot of people that don't believe that, and so that's basically what we're saying, you know, is that there's a difference in, and there's a difference in ideology, there's a difference in thought.\n\nNow, no one can say that he's anti-law enforcement because he is law enforcement. No one can say he's anti-military because he is military. He's not anti-gun; he is in favour of background checks and controls on assault weapons, but you know this is someone that is the very fabric of this nation. But yet at the same time, he values civil rights; he worked for immigration for a brief period of time but he's flown the entire border. He's also been down in Central America so he understands what the root causes are. That's why these people are coming across the border now. He sees that there's no simple fix and he knows that it's not the policy of the current administration that's causing that. He knows that these are factors that would have driven them north no matter who was president.\n\nAnd, there are situations that we've got to change. So I think that there are enough people that these issues resonate with now, that they may have been oblivious to them before January and before the storm in February, but they're not as oblivious as they were before. I think there's some Republicans that will stay home. And this is also another different story. Usually a Congressional race is only in November. This is a local race. We have no way of knowing what's going to happen, because most of the people that vote in the primary and in the general election never show up and vote in a local election. So, it's going to be real interesting to see what happens with this one. I've worked a lot of elections, but this one is the strangest I've ever come across.\n\nBut basically, if you look at the demographics, the district has been steadily turning blue.\n\nWN All right. Moving on to the reason of course that this election was called at all, the death of Mr Ron Wright, what does he feel about his governance &amp;mdash; the governance of the late Ron Wright?\n\nFaith Chatham Ron Wright was the mayor pro tem in Arlington for a number of years, and at the same time he was the chief of staff of Joe Barton. So, Ron Wright is basically just a shadow of Joe Barton. He was only in office one year. He did not have the opportunity to really make his own mark on that area because, for one thing he was battling cancer, and he was denying COVID-19 and ended up, you know, sadly dying from COVID-19. He was doing quite well, from what I understand in battling his cancer, and then he contracted COVID and was dead almost immediately. But he was very extremist in many areas. Mr Eddings is a very devout Christian, but he doesn't go around thumping the Bible, he doesn't go around using his religion as a tool. Ron Wright did.\n\nRon Wright as the, now, I don't know if Mr Eddings would say this, but I would say this, but as the tax collector of Tarrant County he had In God We Trust put on all the envelopes so when you got your tax notice from Tarrant County you got it and it said 'In God We Trust'. He had that clearly on the side of the vehicles, and I'm a Christian too but I don't think that was the appropriate thing to do in those places. And it was done in a very area, but also when he was the mayor pro tem of Arlington, he helped to push through a very extreme gas drilling programme. The way they did that is that they came in, and they first of all leased the city's property, the county's property and the school district's property, and they had the flat production wells and the wells already in all of these neighbourhoods. And then they came to the people and they said \"oh, if you don't sign the gas contract, we'll take the gas anyway.\" But, you know, you've already got this industrial waste dump in your neighbourhood.\n\nAnd so Arlington had, by the time he was no longer mayor pro tem, there were over 300 gas wells in the 99 square miles of Arlington. I used to live there, and I had to leave because I couldn't breathe, the air quality was so bad. I had watched our former Congressman, a wonderful man: Tommy Vandergriff, who was also a Democrat, then Republican, but I have watched him work for years for where we had a good anchor=Noun, where you knew when you built a house what was going to be next to you. And in that one administration, you know, when Ron Wright was there, they managed to &amp;mdash; and of course he was basically also working for Joe Barton &amp;mdash; to push this through for the energy companies. And they basically just completely ruined the entire zoning of Arlington. And, you know, it's made a real problem for homeowners in that area.\n\nSo, there's a lot of problems with Ron Wright in what he did, and he basically did not do anything for the people. There wasn't anything that he fought, he voted time and time again against healthcare, and this district has a higher infant mortality rate than most third-world countries. It has a higher maternal mortality rate than most third-world countries: you're more likely to die within a year of giving birth if you're a woman living in Tarrant County than you are if you live in most African countries. So, he basically is voting against healthcare and voting against birth control, saying that he's pro-life while he's putting in place policies that are causing women and babies to die, and not doing anything about it.\n\nHe didn't do anything about bringing good jobs to the area, he was so determined to use Joe Barton's vote to protect the big oil companies that he didn't do anything about &amp;mdash; he kept their subsidies in place, and did nothing to subsidise the new industries that could create jobs for people. And so, these are some of the problems, what he failed to do. And then, the way he managed to, you know, who his friends were. And there is a place for &amp;mdash; Daryl Eddings is not anti-fossil fuel, he's not anti-energy, he just says, you know, we've got energy companies that have been here for a long time, we don't need to subsidise them. They're already here.\n\nWhat we need to do is we need to go in and help the new industries get started so people can have new jobs that are here, and we need to revise our tax code and restore, you know, the top per cent shouldn't have the amount of tax breaks they have. We have to get a working middle class again. He would prefer to see us go back to the policies that were similar to what Dwight D. Eisenhower had, you know. Eisenhower put in the Interstate Highway System and it opened commerce for the nation. We've got to put in a really robust Internet system so that people can work at home. In Ellis and Navarro County, there were lots of people that their kids couldn't study at home because they didn't have the Internet connectivity. People have trouble working from home because the Internet is so slow. We've got to get it to where every home in America has reliable connectivity so that we can move into the new way of working and the new way of studying.\n\nWN What are some of the most pressing issues Mr Eddings would raise to Congress if elected?\n\nFaith Chatham Healthcare. Housing &amp;mdash; affordable housing. Healthcare, housing and education. The cost of healthcare, housing and education has escalated much more rapidly than peoples' paycheques. We also have to address the national debt; the way we do that is to get people at work, at good-paying jobs. People say \"oh, $15 minimum\", well he's not just interested in a $15 minimum, he's interested in people who are not working to be able to get a good-paying job. And then, the ones that are working, to have an opportunity to get the college and the training that they need, so they can qualify for higher-paying jobs.\n\nSo, if we get people back to work, and then we get people that are underemployed employed better, and have a career ladder. Most people don't have a career ladder anymore. I'm an old woman and there was a career ladder when I was starting out, but you know, when you create a world like has been created by Phil Gramm and Ronald Reagan and those that have followed them, where independent contractors are about the best you can get, that you can get your college degree and you can be one of the best data people in the world but you're competing with people on the other side of the world, and the employers here are hiring them in India, in China, instead of hiring them here in your own community. We've got to change that. What we have done with our computer jobs, we're going to have new industry technologies that we haven't even thought of, and they're going to be the jobs that are going to employ the next generation. We have to make sure that those patents and those jobs are here in America.\n\nIf we do the R&amp;D research and development, we need to get them and have them here in America. And the only way you do that is by revising the tax code so that it's not an incentive to invest abroad, but there is an incentive to invest here, and to invest in research and development and upgrading technology and employees, you know, in the training and the education of your employees. These are things that need to be restored to the tax code, and it can be done out of that percentage of tax that has been gained, has been given in these Republican tax cuts recently that have given us such a hard time. And when we do that, that's going to go ahead and help us rebuild the middle class, and it will help us get over the debt that we're going to have to go into to take care of COVID-19.\n\nWN Your website states \"Tea Party Republicans have neglected residents\" and \"Ronald Reagan's trickle-down economics leaves too many people out in the cold\". Could you please elaborate?\n\nFaith Chatham Quite truthfully. And a lot of what I was just saying. Trickle-down economics was originally when Phil Gramm and Ronald Reagan basically said \"we're going to start giving tax cuts to industry because if we give a tax cut to industry, then the businesses, their profits will trickle down.\" But it didn't work that way. They gave the no-strings-attached tax breaks, and instead industry either &amp;mdash; the people that got the tax breaks &amp;mdash; either just banked it, and usually offshore, or they invested out shore, instead of investing here. So, that's where we are. And in doing that, we lost those jobs. There were lots of people in Ellis and Navarro counties that had union jobs, they had security, they had retirement, they had training, they had healthcare and they knew that they had a job for as long as they did a decent job. And all those jobs have just gone away.\n\nBut the others didn't come in, you know, they really did not come forward. Now, Daryl Eddings is a small business owner, and so, you know, he's not anti-business. But he comprehends that we have got to be able to get our American workforce with some level of protection, and the way we have to do that is we have to outfit investment: we have to invest in our own workforce, and people aren't going to do that unless, you know, it's a shame that it's anchor=Noun and wisely, they're not doing it. But what we've found is we've found a lot more of these businesses have just been sold, you know, off by, you know, somebody buy it and then sell it to make a profit, buy it and sell it to make a profit, buy it and sell it to make a profit, take all the profit out of the good ones.\n\nThere's nothing left for the people. A good example is media; a very good example. I started out in newspaper when I was a young woman, and we never made a lot of money in newspaper, we thought we had a hard time but as I have watched colleagues of mine that work for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the Dallas Morning News and these others: every time their newspaper gets sold, they get less and less and less. And also, it's now gotten somewhere they have cut. There are very few newspapers in the United States that really even have an investigative journalism team. And of course, everybody else always, which, the newspapers find out what the background was before they got on the television and they got on the radio, and so it's hurting on almost every level, but that's just one example.\n\nWe've got to get to the point where we have a tax code that encourages people to invest in our companies here, and invest in our workforce here. And where workers and where companies look up and say \"you know, our workers are valuable.\" And it used to be that way. Workers used to be: you wanted to retain your workers, you didn't want to just have them be a contractor and walk away. And so we've gone over the cheap and it's cost us dearly. And it was very obvious with COVID. We didn't have the supply chain in place to be able to have the equipment we needed to take care of our people.\n\nSo, it's a national security issue, it's a jobs issue, it's an economy issue, it's a moral issue and it's not right for the middle class to be the one that's bearing the anchor=Noun of the taxes, and those who are the most wealthy not paying their fair share. So, you know, and of course, Donald Trump always talked about \"I paid all these taxes\". Well, he's talking about employee taxes. He didn't pay any income taxes, he paid employee taxes: that was the money he collected from the employees out there with only! Laughs It wasn't his paid taxes, you know! And so they look at it and say \"well, I want the cheque\".\n\nAnd I've been a business owner too. I know how hard it is to write those cheques when it's time to pay your employee interest. But your employee taxes, it's not employment taxes, you know; what you collect from your employees you're passing on. We've got to get to the point where it's not the employees that are bearing the brunt of it. We need to share it around better, we need to be fair, it needs to be more equitable. And so this is something that's going to have to be debated, and it's not going to be popular, but it has got to be done. People have got to stop running away from that, and face it: that we do not have a workable tax code.\n\nAnd there's things that we get in place, and they're myths that have existed in this country about Ronald Reagan that the facts don't back up. And we need to go back honestly and look at the facts, and see what happened and where it started &amp;mdash; and it really started with Ronald Reagan and Phil Gramm right here in US Texas 6, and I would like to see it end in US Texas 6. And let's have a new beginning. People will come in and really look at, and it will be better for Democrats, it will be better for Republicans, it will be better.\n\nAnd he's not running just to represent Democrats &amp;mdash; he's running to represent people. He will be there for whoever. He will be there for whoever. He's not going to be there patting people on the back if they say that it was an illegal election because it wasn't an illegal election. Once you have exhausted all of the legal appeals, recounts and you've gone through the courts, then you accept the outcome. You don't go in and try to anchor=Noun the security officers at the Capitol, because your guy didn't win! I've been very unhappy many, many, many times when the election results came in, but I never went out and was violent, I never went out and committed treason, you know, I never tried to do a palace coup. That's what we saw happen in January, and it's really time to bring that back, yeah.\n\nWe need people in office that will not be leading tours of the Capitol for people who are planning on coming in and kidnapping the Speaker of the House and the Vice President of the United States, to keep from the certification of votes. This is the reality, you know. We have Texas, we have congressmen from Texas that literally led tours the day before that insurrection, and it was a time when the Capitol was supposed to be closed; there were not supposed to be any tours! The only ones that were on tours were these people that were, you know, yelling with Trump. And so, we've got to get back and change that around.\n\nThe other thing that's really important is we've got to stop dark money in our elections, we've got to &amp;mdash; and this is a very bipartisan area, the Koch brothers don't like it, but they have done surveys of most of the Republicans, and most of the Republican base said \"we need to know who the millionaires are that are financing our elections; we need the transparency.\" That's a very bipartisan issue. He's very much for revoking Citizens United and getting dark money out of Congress, out of our elections, and we need to have an independent body, an independent body, not elected officials draw the barriers, the boundaries. Elected officials picking their voters is not how this was supposed to work, you know. That's not how we're supposed to be doing it, and so there's some things that need to be done on election reform, and they're reasonable things.\n\nAnd I think in the long run, a lot of Republicans will buy into it. The people in the glass room, some of them in the office won't because it, you know, it protects them in office. But we need to get it to where we're really protecting the people, not protecting the ones who are in front of us.\n\nWN Your website also says: \"I served within the chain of command under the commander-in-chief, but I did not swear an oath to any one man or political party.\" Could you please elaborate on that?\n\nFaith Chatham Okay, there are a lot of people, as of January 6, that are putting Donald Trump &amp;mdash; and I mean, this is appalling to see what some of the churches have been doing &amp;mdash; they've been putting the golden Trump up there like he is some demigod; and there are members of Congress that, instead of recognising how serious it was, they have been very frightened of going against Trump. Several of the Republicans have stated that if it had been a secret vote, that they would have voted to remove him. The repercussions, you know, the repercussions on it. Donald Trump is not to who we swear. You don't swear a code of allegiance to the president of the United States. The commander-in-chief is charged with leading our military, but our military swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. And that's also the oath that the president takes, and that's what Congress takes.\n\nBut instead of looking at what we do to protect the Constitution of the United States, which was to have a peaceful turnover of the government, there were too many of them that continued to say \"this is an illegal election\", \"it was not fair\", you know, and even though the judges by and large were Republican appointees by Donald Trump, they were saying \"oh this isn't fair, some Democrats have done it\", they put out too many lies and they instigated a level of doubt and discord and disharmony that destabilises our country &amp;mdash; and actually led to a large number of people, many of whom were law enforcement agents, and many of whom were veterans that stormed the Capitol with a military plan. It was very clearly executed, this was not spontaneous, it was a plan to go in and forcibly stop the certification of the vote to turnover the presidency to the man who had won the election. And this is not how it's supposed to work.\n\nEvery one of those people in that building has sworn an oath to the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the United States outlines what the process is when we have a question about it, how we answer it, what the process is with the courts. And when it is settled, which it had been, we peaceably turnover power to the next elected administration. It always has been that way except under Donald Trump.\n\nDaryl Eddings came back from Iraq in a coma. He spent eighteen months in a military hospital undergoing multiple surgeries and years of rehab to get to the point where he could work and make a living for his family. He lost people over there that he cares about who were fighting for this country, and for him to sit there and watch what happened on January 6, and to hear the words that came out of the mouth of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and Louie Gohmert and a lot of other elected officials that basically were lies. He knows what it is to be in countries where there are palace coups. And to sit here and see this going on in his own country? Can you imagine what kind of a reaction he has? Can you imagine how it hits him in the gut? How he would decide to put his life on the line?\n\nThis is a man that has always been very private. There were very few photographs of him because he was a US marshal, and he worked on drug interdiction, and he knew that there were people that might recognise him from those missions that were not nice people. And he didn't want them knocking on his door with his family. And he sat down and talked to his family about it and decided to put his face out there, and put his name out there and run for Congress because his that worried about where our nation is right now. He's that worried for his neighbours: Democrats and Republicans, independents and Libertarians.\n\nWN How would Mr Eddings handle the vaccine rollout if elected?\n\nFaith Chatham He's very pleased with how President Biden has done it. The vaccine rollout has been &amp;mdash; Donald Trump was good about getting it accelerated on making it, but he did not have in place a real plan to distribute it. Daryl Eddings, he spent, you know years in emergency management, you know. He's been working on another Master's degree in emergency management, but he would be working very much like what President Biden has been doing. He'd be working with the scientists, he would be working with the supply chain, he'd be working with the military, he'd be working with the nurses to get it out to as many people as possible as fast as possible, and as efficiently as possible. And that's one thing he's very efficient is when there's something that needs to be done, he knows how to move the people and move the resources and assess the problem and get the job done.\n\nAnd so on that area, he's been much more relieved to see what has happened this year than what we were watching last year.\n\nWN How would Mr Eddings help the economically disadvantaged if elected?\n\nFaith Chatham Jobs. Very definitely jobs. Jobs and access to education, and also expansion of healthcare. Right here in Texas, the Texas Legislature and the Governor refused to expand Medicaid but we're basically paying for other states to have Medicaid! There's so many things: everybody that has held a private health insurance policy is paying a higher premium because we have so many uninsured people in Texas. He would be working to, you know, to expand it, to look at the ACA Affordable Care Act, see what the problems are instead of revoking it like Joe Barton has tried to do; he would basically be working to look at it, to see what the problems are and to find a solution to make it work for as many people as possible &amp;mdash; not to eliminate the options for private healthcare, not at all &amp;mdash; but yet to give more people an opportunity to.\n\nAlso, he would be looking for ways that people could have an opportunity to buy a home again. Housing cost is a big problem. We have too many families that are being pushed out of their housing, and we have too many veterans living under the bridges, and he has worked on veterans' housing with a number of non-profit organisations for years; that's been one of the things that he's worked very heavily on is veterans' housing. And, he also has been very active on veterans' mental health issues, and so a lot of families are suffering because of mental health issues and they don't have the opportunity to have the drug treatment on demand that they need there. If there's a long waiting list for it, when you get ready for it there's a waiting list, and you know with an addict, somebody that has a substance abuse problem, if you don't strike when the striking is hot, if they have to wait then they're not ready to go in and do anything about it.\n\nAnd so that's one of the big problems he'd be working with, very much. He's done a lot on suicide prevention and mental health issues and PTSD post-traumatic stress disorder. And these are issues that are not Democratic or Republican, they're not black, they're not white: these are problems that, because every time we have a lot of veterans that come home, and then there are a lot of us that are suffering from PTSD that were in military, you know, they are military things; people that have been in school shootings or in different areas of that area have PTSD. And so, we need a better network, a better social network.\n\nAnd then, we also have to strengthen our retiree social network. Retired people shouldn't be paying some guaranteed student loans out of their Social Security cheque, and when somebody has been working for a company they should be able to take their retirement plan with them. And what we've allowed is in there are too many cases of corporations declaring bankruptcy to get out of paying the retirement for their employees, and then they leave it to the federal government to take up the slack. We may need to go with something like what we have for workers' comp where there's an insurance: it's an insurance policy instead of a pension plan, and that it goes with the employee wherever they're going, so that after you've worked twenty years if you've worked at five or six or seven different jobs, you still have some security.\n\nAnd we have to keep Social Security, you know. Social Security is a &amp;mdash; we can't do it, but the way we do that is by putting in work, you know. People have to work: them ore we work, the more we pay in, the stronger these systems are. But as long as our jobs are offshore, as long as employers can just, you know, call you in as an independent contractor and let you go, you know, whenever it suits them and not, you know, not in that area, as long as we have no protection for our employees and there's no investment by the companies into our workforce, we're not going to have the resources we need for people to have the retirement as necessary.\n\nHouses, jobs, retirement, access to infrastructure, health rights: those are the things that everybody needs. Those are not Democrat needs, and Republican doesn't. Those are the things everybody needs, and that is exactly what he is, that's exactly what he'll be working for. And also, everybody's vote must count, and we need to know that it's counted fairly, and that when that election is over that you can go through the process and you may find out that some of it was wrong and you can correct it, but if you find out that it wasn't wrong, then you just, you know, you just take it on your chin and you just wait for the next election. That's the American Way, and that's where we need to go back to.\n\nWN What are his opinions on President Biden?\n\nFaith Chatham He is relieved to see the things that President Biden has been doing. He feels like reversing most of President Trump's executive orders was a good move. He is pleased to see the calibre of people with experience to accept the mission of the departments they're being appointed to, that'll be his appointees, you know. Because we found under Trump people that had no credentials whatsoever were appointed, that was mainly cronyism, and they were appointed to destroy the departments, not to build them up. Daryl Eddings believes in good government, not no government. That doesn't mean that government gets to do everything, you know, but basically we always try to do better.\n\nWe had a bureaucracy that basically, our civil service was designed so that it didn't, you know, the civil service and the Hatch Act worked for us; my mother was still in civil service. I didn't even know she was a Democrat until she was dying, I thought she had voted Republican until she was on her deathbed because she took the Hatch Act so seriously. Laughs She didn't even let her kids know what her partisanship was. But because a federal employee is supposed to be non-partisan in the way they conduct their business, we had a steady transition, and we also had experts who knew what was going on, was there to continue running things until the next one is in place. That's been really tattered and shattered, you know, in so many areas.\n\nOne good example is the post office department, you know, the post office department. There's no for-profit business that's ever going to make profit serving every community in the nation, you know. No company is going to make a profit serving every community in the nation. And yet at the same time, they're going out of their way to destroy the United States Postal Office that basically services every community in the nation. And so, we have to go back in and look at that, so it's good.\n\nHe's for people that are science, data, look at the facts, go with the facts, use your science, use your data, rely on the experts, get the politics out of it and make the decision based off what will work. That's Daryl Eddings. Make the decision based on truth, the best information available, verify it and put people in charge that have a background and the expertise to do the job, and who believe that the mission, as is set out in our legislation of that agency, is what they really have a commitment to. If they don't have a commitment to the mission of that agency, they should not be put in charge of that agency. And so he sees Biden trying to do that, you know, more so. And in the last administration, they wouldn't.\n\nWN Well, we've talked about Mr Biden, so what are Mr Eddings' thoughts on former President Trump?\n\nFaith Chatham Oh...he never called him the commander-in-chief, as he was out of the military by the time, he was retired by the time he came in, but he never called him the commander-in-chief, he called him '45' because he never earned his respect. There was not any reason for Donald Trump to be leading our troops. Donald Trump was putting too many people at risk on a whim without reading the intelligence briefings, without listening to his generals, without, you know, unless it was an echo chamber that was feeding his ego, he had no time for it. And it was dangerous, it was dangerous. He's relieved that he's no longer, you know, I mean it's not that he was a Republican, it was that he was a danger, and that he was a danger to this nation, he was a danger to the men and women who are putting their lives on the line to watch out for us.\n\nAnd also, he violated some of our greatest allies, you know. The things that he did to our allies was unconscionable, and it wasn't just the ones that were our peacetime allies; he basically betrayed some of our allies when they were, with their lives were in danger and they were literally fighting for their very lives. And so the betrayals, you know, it's very difficult for a man who has had the kind of life that Daryl Eddings has to watch what happened under Donald Trump, and not be appalled.\n\nWN What are his thoughts on the ongoing crisis at the Southern border?\n\nFaith Chatham Well, he worked for immigration. And, at the same time he understands, and then he also worked on drug interdiction, so he's flown from the top to the bottom, but he's also been in those countries. And he knows that it's not what our policy is that is bringing them here. What's bringing them here is what's happening in their countries. It's the terror, the crime, the severe poverty and it was bad enough because they're always having hurricanes and disasters, they're just knocking them off the line, but when you get down to it you also have COVID-19 that's on top of it. But he knows that if someone is terrified, and they believe that they or their children are going to die if they stay in their neighbourhood, they're going to go somewhere else. And, they're not going to be able to keep them back; they're going to go wherever it is they think that they will be safer &amp;mdash; maybe not safe, but safer.\n\nSo he knows that those are situations that &amp;mdash; it's a humanitarian problem, but it's going to have to be solved on a multi-anchor=Adjective attack. It has to be solved in co-operation with the countries to help the countries counter the drug and the terror and the gang activity. They also have to be helped in a way that deals with the poverty. And then, we have to be as humane as we can in receiving those who came. We had four years of the United States government refusing to process asylum applications in a timely manner. We were already understaffed before this happened, and then he made that to try to make it as a punishment. You can't make it as a punishment.\n\nHe also knows that there is no way to put a wall up, because he's flown from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico; just the terrain would make it totally impossible. And besides that, what are you going to do with a fence when you have two oceans on both sides of you, you know. So you're not going to keep people over. The higher the fence, they're going to come over. So, we have to find a way. But as a law enforcement officer, he really believes we have to be able to allow the people who are here to come out of the shadows, because as long as we have people in the shadows, and they're afraid to co-operate with law enforcement, it's harder to take care of the drug dealers in the cartels, and it's harder to take care of criminals that are preying on them.\n\nAnd as long as a criminal can prey on somebody, and there's somebody there that was a witness or a victim, and they can't co-operate with law enforcement, we're all less safe. So, we have to do something to give them a chance to have legal residency so they're not afraid of being deported, so that they can co-ordinate with law enforcement here, and he sees that as a real nice thing. And he did go down to Brownsville with ACLU American Civil Liberties Union when they were under the Trump Administration; he actually went into the courtroom and saw children that were being brought before the court, without an adult. He saw multiple immigrants, multiple people that were in orange shirts, orange sheets that were teetered together, they will all fly together as a mass thing to be deported, not even having an individual chance before a judge. He saw things that were not fine, as a criminal justice person, that was not fair, and that were not humane.\n\nAnd what's happening now is very sad, but they're at least trying to take care of these children, they're trying to move them out of those shelters as fast as possible, they're trying to get them, they're trying to speed up the background checks &amp;mdash; that's one of the big problems: they have to do background checks on these people that are coming forward to be their guardians, because they're children that have literally ended up being sex trafficking by people who claimed them, so you have to do that. It's not an instant process, but yet at the same time what you do with those children, and the mental health support that they have while they're in there, you don't go in there and tell them that their parents have deserted them. You don't lie to the parents and tell them, you know, those things, so we have to be honest, we have to be truthful with the people, we have to do the best job we can do, and our best job isn't good enough, but in the last administration it was cruel! You know, it wasn't that it wasn't good enough, it was that it violated the Geneva Conventions in almost every way.\n\nAnd also, we test them. You know, they were refusing even to give those kids flu shots under Trump. We test them, and, you know, we do our best to take care of them, and we try to get them out of our custody as fast as possible, because the more you have together, the higher likelihood of sexual assault, or violence, or harm to one of them. And so, you have to process them, and get them out as fast as possible, and protect them because, you know, it's just a nightmare. But yeah, he was very concerned for the children; he's got seven grandchildren of his own, and what he saw as a former INS Immigration and Naturalization Service person knows that was not how it was supposed to operate. And it still has a ways to go now, but at least they're trying to do it, instead of trying to do the opposite.\n\nWN What are his thoughts on the size of the American military?\n\nFaith Chatham That's one question that we haven't discussed: about the size of the military. I can't really give you an answer. I do know that he believes very much in the military, he believes in the military; it is a peacekeeping operation, he believes that it is beneficial in that it is one of the ways that people who come from poorer families can get an education, can have a chance to buy a house with a reasonable area, you know. If you live through your military service, you have benefits, but also there's a lot of people that do not survive their military service.\n\nHe doesn't believe that the military should be used for everything, you know. We have reasons to use the military; we don't use the military just at the whim of the commander-in-chief. There has to be a valid reason to use the military, and so that's one of the reasons that he trusted Hillary Clinton more than he trusted Donald Trump, you know, on that area.\n\nWN What are his thoughts on the criminal justice system?\n\nFaith Chatham Well, he was an officer, of course. He believes in it, and he also believes that we have many wonderful law enforcement people, and we have some bad apples. We have too many racists that are in the, you know. White nationalists do not belong in law enforcement. There are some people that do not have the temperament to be in law enforcement. And he became a friend of Sandra Bland's mother during the time that she was trying to find out what happened to her daughter, what the real circumstances were of her death in custody, and he has looked very closely with her, over the years, that she actually came to Texas in 2018, I guess it was; maybe this was '16, 2018, and volunteered in Dr Shirley McKellar's campaign because of the relationship they established.\n\nHe was very pleased to see the Sandra Bland Act signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott. It does some things that are important; he would like to see the George Floyd Act and the Sandra Bland Act, those elements of it be merged and passed nationally. The Sandra Bland Act has transparency, it has a lot of protection, it has a lot of things in dealing with the mentally ill and drug addiction; very often a jailer would just say they had gone by and checked on them when they didn't, so it calls for electronic monitoring so they have to push the button right there at the cell to show that they have checked on that person. It basically says that if there's ever a death in custody that you don't get to investigate it yourself, it has to be an independent law enforcement agency to do the investigation.\n\nSo those are the protections. Then, the George Floyd Act has some others that are important too; now the George Floyd Act basically goes in and says if there is a registry, then we need to have a registry of law enforcement officers that have been discharged because of not following the protocol. And so that's pretty controversial with it, but he also believes that we have to go in and address; he believes that everyone should be able; he believes in protecting the Second Amendment rights, obviously, he is a gun owner.\n\nBut, he believes that there are AK-47s, he believes there are military weapons, and weapons that can be modified to be military weapons, that belong on the battlefield, and that rifles and long guns should be used for hunting game, not hunting people. They shouldn't be worn around as a fashion statement into restaurants to intimidate other diners. We need to be able to have everyone licensed, everyone background-checked, everyone to have training. And we have to close the loopholes of gun purchases. There's still going to have the people that are getting a hold of the weapons illegally, but if you take care of that, you can then address the others. But, law enforcement are designed to shoot to kill if there is a threat: that's their protective life.\n\nHe believes that we have got to stop using our police for everything that we haven't got covered. They're not supposed to be the box we check when we don't have anything else to do it. Every 9-1-1 call should not be going to the police. If it's mental health, drug addiction, we should have people who are trained in mental health and trained in drug addiction do the first call on that. You might have a police officer with you, but you shouldn't, you know, those tiny areas.\n\nHe serves on the Veterans Administration's Mental Health Advocacy Board; he's an officer on that. He works as a mentor, he volunteers as a mentor in a one-year programme, it's called the \"Veterans Court\" in Dallas, where you work with someone who has been in drug addiction or mental, you know, has just gotten in trouble with the law, and it's aversion programme, and you have a mentor and you work with that person 24/7 wherever they need them, and he does that. He works from down in East Texas, they realised that there were thirteen counties that did not have access to in-person psychiatric counselling, and social work counselling. He worked to see that they got it, and that the VA paid for it, so yeah, he has some real, real concerns with what's happening with the mentally ill, and the people that are falling through the cracks.\n\nHe knows that he's where he's at because people helped him when he came back, you know. And he sees a lot of veterans that are falling through the cracks, and he's very concerned about that. And then, there are other people that are falling through the cracks. And so, law enforcement, you know, law enforcement needs. And also, he's a black man. He's got black grandchildren. He's a law enforcement person; you know, the bias that goes, the more likely you're going to be shot by a police officer if you're mentally ill, or you're a person of colour. Those are things that would concern any father, any grandfather.\n\nAnd yet at the same time, the officers shouldn't have, you know, if an officer is at greater risk of being killed now because of the number of guns that are out there. How do you know, if you're in a grocery store, and someone comes in with a gun, if they're coming in just because they've got a licence and they're just shopping, or if they're coming in to do something. We used to be able to know that if somebody came into Piggly Wiggly with a gun, they didn't have a good purpose, you know. They can stop them close to do the door. Now, they're right up on the aisle with you, before you get a chance; they're right up on top of you, able to do a lot of damage. So, there's a lot more risk to law enforcement right now than there was before, we have to address it on both ways.\n\nWN What does he feel on Medicare?\n\nFaith Chatham Medicare? The best, most efficiently-managed healthcare delivery in the nation. It's not perfect, but it is definitely, when you look at the cost of administration for Medicare, it is the lowest of any insurance company, any insurance divider; even military is not as efficiently run as Medicare. But, he would like to look at possibly a buy-in for people that are 50, to where some people might be able to buy into it; he's not sure, but he thinks that something should be evaluated. He wants to put on the table of our system, and look at what the flaws are, see where we started with the Affordable Care Act, what we know now are the problems, the inequities, see how we can correct those, and how we can get more people covered, and it is by making Medicare go a little bit longer, or if it's a way of jacking up the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut also, he believes that people should have dental coverage, you know. That's a way to find a way to make dental coverage affordable. So, you know, there's a lot of foreign=suppress that's caused because of bad dentistry, and there's a lot of people that can't afford to go to the dentist, and it concerns him that people are working and they can't afford to, you know, they're too poor to go to the dentist when they need to, they're too poor to go to the doctor, they're too poor to get that psychiatric counselling that they need. And so, the way that we do this is we invest in our people, and that's one of the investments in the people.\n\nWe also have to see how do we pay for it. And that's the other chance it is not an easy solution. We have to look at what we can do, and what's reasonable and how do we pay for it. And those are questions that, instead of fighting over it we need to come to the table and solve, you know. Really look at them, and debate them, and research them and solve them instead of just asking the book when we're with them. He's a person that basically looks at it, listens and figures out a way to get it done. And he's done that since he's left &amp;mdash; he's done that when he was in the military, and he's done it since he left the military. Operation Battle Buddy is an example, because when he was with Brooke Medical &amp;mdash; now, there's two organisations: this isn't the K9 unit, this is the one that does the mentoring, but he founded that organisation. When he was the CEO of it, they were mentoring 20 thousand vets that had, you know, come through Brooke Military Hospital.\n\nBut he looks at it, he sees a need and he finds a way to get it done: that's what they need down in East Texas with the mental health services, and that's what he's done with some veterans' housing projects in different areas. So, and that's just as an individual. And so, as a congressperson I believe that he has the relationship with a number of people in Congress, and they'll look at him and they'll see his heart, and see his skill and see his willingness to solve problems. You know, you gravitate together: those who are really wanting to find solutions find ways to find solutions, and that's where he'll be; he'll be with the ones that are looking to find the solution.\n\nWN What are his thoughts on President Biden's recent talks with China on March 19, 2021?\n\nFaith Chatham I don't know, we haven't talked about that. So that's one, on all these mountains and mountains of things we have not talked about China, other than what's happened with trade. So, I can't even answer that one.\n\nWN What are his thoughts, then, on the rise in anti-Asian sentiment as a result of the pandemic and recent shooting in Atlanta?\n\nFaith Chatham Oh, it's deplorable. Hate and discrimination coming against any person is an abomination to him. He considers one of his proudest moments was when he was on the Pettus Bridge with the late honourable John Lewis. He does not believe in, you know, I mean if you're Muslim, if you're Asian, if you're LGBT, if you're a woman, if you're black, if you're Hispanic, you're an American, and you should be treated with respect as a human being. And no one, in this country of any race is responsible for COVID-19. Nobody here caused it, nobody here brought it over here, you know, there's some people that are responsible for not helping us deal with it in a timely manner, you know, there's some people that dropped the ball on it, but we did not cause it. And just because of your ethnicity, you know, you definitely should not in that area, so the discrimination in the attacks on them are very troubling.\n\nWN The power outages of February left millions without power, sometimes for days, including of course, the sixth district. Its damages are currently estimated at US$195 billion and 111 estimated to have been killed. How will Mr Eddings prevent this from happening again, should he be elected?\n\nFaith Chatham On the federal level: require all energy transmission sites to be listed and winterised. Without protecting them out on the cheap, you know. I mean, instead of just keeping them from having to do that, here in Texas, we know that there's a piece of paper. They can just have them listed of which ones were supposed to get that, and also they did not have the winterisation. Our pipelines should have been buried deeper, but the pipelines doesn't require it. So, on a federal level we're probably going to have to go in and put some controls in on a federal level to address these issues, these issues.\n\nAnd also, there has to be some kind of control put in on the profiteering schemes of energy. Here in Texas, Joe Barton, Greg Abbott and certain legislators have done their very best to protect their big donors at the expense of everybody else, and it's cost people lives. And you know, now Abbott's trying to deflect from it, you know, he's sent people down to the border, he's tried all kinds of things. He's done his math bit, all this stuff to deflect from the fact that he really blew it...but he really blew it, and he basically &amp;mdash; they sat there and they knew, they knew from 2011 what was going to happen. They were told in 2011 what they needed to do, and every year in January my electric bill always jumped up even though I didn't use any more electricity.\n\nAnd every Texan has paid through the nose because they have willingly taken compression stations offline so they could get those higher prices in January, and this time it crashed. And they still got them, you know. Two and three and sometimes even a thousand per cent higher: that's profiteering, that's schemes, and that has to do with the failure of politicians to look out for the people of Texas. And the buck rests not just with the PUC Public Utility Commission of Texas and not just when what was left, the buck rests with the Governor, and with certain people who have been in office that have been the real protectors of that sector at all costs. That sector is an important sector, but they should not be allowed to profiteer at the expense of the Texas citizens.\n\nWN What sets Mr Eddings apart from other candidates in the Democratic Party; of course, there are multiple running, there are multiple Democrats, multiple Republicans, multiple everyone. So, what sets him apart?\n\nFaith Chatham There are some others that are veterans that are running on the Democrat and Republican sides, but none of them have the width of experience he has. None of them have the experience in emergency management. It was really an eye-opener for me during Hurricane Katrina when I realised that I couldn't just call the people that were running the show in Arlington while we were receiving them, because they were locked in a, you know, in a secure area and the public had no access to the telephone in that area. A state of emergency, which is martial law is a very serious thing, and most citizens don't understand what happens during that.\n\nHe does, because he has worked states of emergency for years in California, and then the senior operations officer over there, so if something happens in the district and he's in Congress he's going to know what's happening, he's going to be able to put his hands on them, he's going to be able to know who to contact, how to contact them, what to look for, what usually happens where the break-down is, to take care of things: that's the level that he has. Also, he comes with them. This is a personal situation: I travelled with him a lot, and he was the security person on our team. And usually, we never, you know usually, if there was something we wanted it was no problem, but if it was something that had to do with security we always knew that if he nodded or said no that it was no, because he is always looking out for the security of everyone around him.\n\nIf you're in his neighbourhood, he's going to be as concerned about your security as he is going to be about his own wife's security. That's where he looks at. He looks at what is going to keep people alive, and at the same time respect their freedom to be the very best that they can be. That's how he is. He is the most &amp;mdash; I'll tell you, he's a hard candidate to work for, because he's so modest! You know, I mean he's unlike any politician I've ever worked with because he's not a politician, he is a person that is &amp;mdash; he's usually finding solutions and pulling other people together to make them happen, and then he pushes them to the foreground but doesn't take any credit for what he instigated, for what he did.\n\nHe's not out there to take vows for himself, he's out there to make things better. He sincerely is out there to make things better. You know, of course that's coming from somebody who knows him, and I wouldn't be doing this &amp;mdash; I would not be doing this if I didn't know him as well as I do, because basically I said \"I'm not doing this again!\" I've done enough of that, you know, it's time for somebody else to look to own this ship, but yeah, he's just, he's a very rare individual.\n\nAnd also, in the years I have known him I have never once had something the man told me that I couldn't take at face. He has never even covered up, you know, I mean he might not say anything about it but there's never been one field, one attempt to misdirect anyone I have ever seen in all the years I've known him. That's not something you come across in these politicians. I don't know how you put that in the story, but that's just not; he's just not your normal egg, you know. He's just not normal egg.\n\nWN How has COVID-19 affected the campaign?\n\nFaith Chatham Oh, enormously. Because for one thing, block walking: usually, you're out meeting people and rubbing hands and all that, and that's practically every interview, every meeting is by Zoom, you know, we're just now getting ready to starting with block walking where we're having to, you know, all of that we're trying to, you know, we'll try to get people vaccinated so that they can be out there. We've done the masks, social distancing and we have Dr McKellar, who is a RN Registered nurse, who was a commander over military units in Iraq, in the Middle East, who has basically set down what our COVID-19 protocols are.\n\nIt makes all the difference in the world on how we did it; it made a big difference in just being able to file. Usually when you file, you go into different Democratic club meetings and you go to your neighbours, and you get your petition signatures. Well, when he said he was going to try and do petition signatures in three days during a pandemic, I said \"it couldn't happen\", but he got his veteran buddies out there and they basically collected the, you know 5500 signatures that we needed. We didn't use them, because we didn't have time to check them out to make sure they were valid, and we still paid the money but to be able to make contact with that many people is astronomical.\n\nSo, we're still doing the things that we can do, and you know, in next week we're going to actually start literature drops instead of, normally you go and you knock on the door, you try to talk to people, we're going to be trying to do literature drops. Somebody comes out and gets them to talk to them, but they'll be at distance and everybody'll have a mask and, you know, that whole kind of area. So, it makes it very different.\n\nAnd also, people are hurting, you know. We're dealing with people who are in greater need, even if they have the roof over their head and the money isn't the situation, they've got emotional needs, they've got psychological needs, they've got grieving needs that have gone on. And so, everyone is in a very different place this year than they were last year.\n\nAnd also, if it were not for COVID, two of the three seats that are coming up this month in Congress would not be having special elections. One of them in Louisiana was because the congressman took a job in the Biden administration, but the other one is because the young man died of COVID-19, and so did Ron Wright. So, COVID is making the difference politically and opening seats up, and that's not how you plan on running. It also means that this is the most complex election &amp;mdash; we had fifty days to do what normally you do in eighteen months in a congressional race. And just to file the paperwork and get the checking account to do those kinds of things is astronomical.\n\nAnd also, a candidate usually has months in which to get his one minute, his two minute, his three minute elevator speech, and to get all, you know all that kind of stuff, and to get the issues, and you did it all at the same time in very accelerated speeds. And you're running against &amp;mdash; there's 23 people on the ballot, who knows what in the world that's going to do, and you can't judge, you can't go back and look at any other election and make a guess about what the turnout's going to be. Because, even if it was another special election it wouldn't have been a special election between these candidates, you know. And if it was a congressional race, it wouldn't have been a special election with your local candidate, so it's just a crapshoot, you know, who knows what's going to happen here.\n\nBut we do know this: that whatever we do, we will be building some infrastructure, we'll be identifying some voters, we will be engaging some voters that may not have been engaged, we will be bringing out some folks that voted in 2020 to a local election for a congressional race, and maybe some of these folks will get in the habit of voting in their municipal elections, and we have a difference, you know. And that may be a good one, because if they get in a habit when they're young, then maybe they'll continue doing that. So, you know, whatever happens &amp;mdash; there's a good side and a difficult side anyway you check it.\n\nWN If Mr Eddings isn't elected this time, what do you anticipate his ambitions for the future would be?\n\nFaith Chatham He's already said that he's running in 2022, you know, if he isn't elected. In fact, we had a discussion today about his filing his FEC Federal Election Commission intention to run, you know, and I put it out to him, you know \"you've already got your checking account, you've already got your ads clean, you've already got a lot of stuff done, and so, you know just go with it.\" Yeah, his intention is to run in the 20s, he's been thinking about running for a long time, he just hadn't thought about running this year because he didn't know this seat was going to be open.\n\nWN Light-hearted question to end this: which historical figure would he identify with most and why, or which historical figure do you think he identifies with most and why?\n\nFaith Chatham Okay, he says the two that he admires most, and that he would rather fashion himself after would be John Lewis and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And that is because they each faced great discrimination, they each persevered and they each opened doors to segments of people that many people thought would never be opened, and basically he said \"if it is necessary, it is not impossible.\" You can't afford for it to be impossible if it's something people desperately, finally need, and so you continue working for that as long as it takes to take care of it, and those are two conclusive of that, so he looks at that.\n\nThis man hasn't got a misogynistic bone in his body, I mean, it's just incredible, you know. I've asked him what he thought about Don't ask, don't tell in the military, and he said \"some of the best soldiers I've ever known: men and women were under don't ask don't tell, and it was good for them to be able to come out of the covers on that type area.\" He's not at all, he has no problems with LGBTQ in the military. And he also truly has no problems with women because he was staunchly behind Hillary Clinton, and he has put the last eight years of his life on hold to try to get Shirly McKellar elected over Louis Gohmert down in East Texas.\n\nSo, he just, you know, he's a rare bird.\n\nWN Any final comments?\n\nFaith Chatham Well, I think I'm pretty well commented!

    "original_text": "2008-09 financial crisisIn a televised speech from the White House at 16:00 UTC today, President of the United States Barack Obama presented a reorganization plan following the 12:00 UTC announcement by General Motors that it had filed for bankruptcy and Chapter 11 protection from its creditors, the largest bankruptcy of a U.S. manufacturing company.\n\nDescribing the problem with the company as one that had been \"decades in the making,\" Obama explained the rationale behind his proposed reorganization plan for General Motors. He stated that his intent was not to \"perpetuate the bad business decisions of the past,\" and that loaning General Motors money, when debt was its problem, would have been doing exactly that. His plan, he stated, was for the United States government, in conjunction with the governments of Canada and Ontario (which he thanked for their roles alongside the government of Germany which he thanked for its role in selling a corporate stake in GM Europe), to become shareholders in General Motors. The United States government would hold a 60% stake. The government will give GM a capital infusion of US$30 billion in addition to the funds it has already received.\n\nOf the government ownership he stated that he refused \"to let General Motors and Chrysler become wards of the state\", and described the bankruptcy of Chrysler, and the bankruptcy of General Motors that he envisioned as being \"quick, surgical, bankruptcies\". He pointed to the bankruptcy of Chrysler as an example of what he envision for General Motors, but stated that General Motors was a \"more complex company\" than Chrysler.\n\nResponding to challenges voiced by political opponents, before the speech, that the federal government would actively participate in the affairs of the restructured company, he stated that he had \"no interest\" in running GM, and that the federal government would \"refrain from exercising its rights\" as a corporate shareholder for the most part. In particular, he stated that the federal government would not exercise its rights as a shareholder to dictate \"what new type of car to make.\" He stated that he expected the restructured GM to make \"high quality, safe, and fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow,\" and several times described what he anticipated as \"better\" and \"fuel-efficient\" cars, after a streamlining of GM's brands.\n\nHe said to the general public that \"I will not pretend that the hard times are over.\" He described the financial hardship that some — shareholders, communities based around GM plants, GM dealers, and others — would undergo as a \"sacrifice for the next generation\" on their parts, so that their children could live in \"an America that still makes things,\" concluding that one day the United States might return to a time when the maxim (a widely-repeated mis-quotation of what Charles Erwin Wilson once testified before the U.S. Senate when nominated for the position of Secretary of Defense) would once more be true that \"what is good for General Motors is good for the United States of America.\"",

CNN reports that two of the people killed were climbing up the mountain in an attempt to assist others.\n\nAP says that about two dozen climbers began the accent of K2, the world's second-highest mountain, Friday after the weather had cleared. Climbers are listed as from the Netherlands, South Korea, Italy, Norway, France, Nepal, Serbia, Pakistan and Ireland.\n\nTrouble began on Sunday when several climbers decided to turn back citing rope placement problems. CNN reports the group was climbing in two teams and both were descending from near the summit when an a large chuck of ice fell sweeping three people off the mountain.\n\nThe ice triggered an avalanche which caused confusion within the party.\n\nWilco Van Rooijen, one of the two rescued Dutch climbers, spoke to AP via phone. He blames poor planning in addition to the avalanche.\n\n\"Everything was going well to Camp Four, and on summit attempt, everything went wrong,\" Van Rooijen said.\n\nHe told AP that a low-cloud bank caused whiteout on the mountain, but he chose to begin his decent from the area near the summit.\n\n\"There was a Korean guy hanging upside down,\" Van Rooijen told AP. \"There was a second Korean guy who held him with a rope but he was also in shock and then a third guy was there also, and they were trying to survive but I had also to survive.\"\n\nOne stranded climber, Marco Confortola, an Italian who spoke with his brother by phone, described the events as hellish.\n\n\"Up there it was hell. During the descent, beyond 8,000 meters (26,000 feet), due to the altitude and the exhaustion I even fell asleep in the snow and when I woke up I could not figure out where I was,\" Confortola told the ANSA news agency.\n\nA helicopter rescue for Confortola had to be delayed due to poor weather. He told his brother that he was able to walk down to the base camp.\n\nCNN reports that this is the deadliest accident on K2 since records were kept in 1939. 66 people — not counting those in the latest incident — have died on the mountain since then.",

    "original_text": "Taiwan's former President, Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁), has been conditionally released on bail, some ten hours after he was indicted for corruption. Speaking to media at the Taipei District Court, he said: \"I want to thank my lawyers, members of the Democratic Progressive Party and my supporters who have given me huge encouragement. I am grateful to those who cared for, supported and looked after me so I could get through the hardest and loneliest 32 days of my life in prison.\" He earns the historical distinction of being the first ex-president of the Republic of China to be indicted for criminal offenses and could suffer life imprisonment if convicted.\n\nAlong with 13 other family members and close associates, including his wheelchair-bound wife, son Chen Chih-Chung, and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, Chen was indicted Friday on charges of embezzling government funds and laundering money or ill-gotten bribes. The panel of three judges ruled he should appear at future court hearings and must not leave the country nor change his address.\n\nProsecutor Lin Che-hui accused Chen of having \"embezzled 104 million New Taiwan dollars ($3.12 million) from a special presidential fund, and received bribes of $11.73 million in connection with a government land procurement deal and a separate construction project; the damning piece of evidence was the presence of NT$740 million ($22.2 million) in cash stashed in a Taipei bank safety vault held by the Chens.\" Yuanta Securities director Tu Li-ping said, \"she hand delivered NT$200 million ($6 million) in cash to Wu at the presidential residence in 2006 on behalf of executives of an affiliated bank; the money was an incentive for Wu not to interfere with a merger the bank was pursuing.\"\n\nChen insists on his innocence. Contradicting the 100-page indictment, he said that \"the $21 million his wife wired to their son's Swiss bank accounts came from leftover campaign donations. Taiwanese law permits such donations to be kept by political candidates.\"\n\nIn 1975, Chen married Wu Shu-chen (吳淑珍), the daughter of a physician. The couple has a daughter, Chen Hsing-yu (陳幸妤), who is a dentist; and a son, Chen Chih-Chung (陳致中), who, having received a law degree in Taiwan, studied at and graduated with a M.A. degree from the University of California in 2005.\n\nIn November 2006, Chen's wife Wu Shu-chen and three other high ranking officials of the Presidential Office were indicted for corruption, charged with misappropriating NT$14.8 million (USD$450,000) of government funds using falsified documents. Due to the protection from the Constitution against prosecution of the sitting president, Chen could not be prosecuted until he left office, and he was not indicted, but was alleged to be an accomplice on his wife's indictment.\n\nChen's term as President of the Republic of China ended in May 2008. Immediately thereafter, prosecutors began investigating him regarding allegations that he misused his discretionary \"state affairs fund\", as well as his connection to the first family's money-laundering activities. He resigned from the Democratic Progressive Party on August 15, 2008, one day after admitting to falsifying past campaign expenses and wiring campaign contributions to overseas accounts.\n\nIn November 2008, Chen was escorted by a security staff, into the Taipei prosecutor's office for questioning. After 6 hours, he left the Supreme Court prosecutor`s office in handcuffs, was arrested and detained. The charges each carry a minimum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. Following a 6 day hunger strike while in detention, Chen collapsed and was rushed to Taipei's Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, where he was later transferred to Panchiao Hospital for force-feeding. Despite Chen's lack of interest in appealing, his lawyer Cheng Wen-long completed a motion seeking his release from detention and filed a notice of appeal of the court's decision, along with a petition for constitutional interpretation to restrain actions violative of the Constitution.\n\nProsecutor General, Chen Tsung-ming said that after Chen’s case had been removed to the Taipei Local Court, he would re-file a petition for Chen's detention. Chen and the main opposition DPP have accused President Ma Ying-jeou's administration of \"using the scandals to plan a political plot against the former leader.\"\n\nMeanwhile, The Straits Times reported that \"prosecutors are to investigate former President of the Republic of China and Chairman of the Kuomintang from 1988 to 2000, Lee Teng-hui on suspicion of money laundering, based on allegations made by Chen during his own questioning recently that his predecessor transferred large funds abroad through dummy accounts.\" Mr. Lee angrily denied the accusations concerning \"a suspected transfer of 50 million Taiwan dollars (US$2.26 million) to Mr Lee from a local stock investor via overseas dummy accounts.\" Charges also included transactions made at the end of Lee's tenure and at the beginning of Chen's term, including \"one billion Taiwan dollars that had been wired to various countries including Singapore.\"\n\nThe China Post calls for calm and urges fair trial for Chen. \"All the people should wait patiently for the outcome of the trial ... They shouldn't do anything to influence the judges in any way, because the rule of law in Taiwan is at stake. We should show the world that Taiwan is a democracy where anybody who commits a crime, be he a man on the street or a former president, is duly punished.\" it said.",

While details about the passengers are not available, information regarding condition aboard the ferry have been quickly spreading, including reports that there were not enough lifejackets and lifeboats for everyone, and that alarm systems were malfunctioning. The crew has also been accused of ignoring problems.\n\nWitnesses are reporting that a fire started aboard the ferry approximately 90 minutes into the trip, possibly either on the deck where the vehicles were stored or in the engine room. It appears that the fire spread quickly and filled the ferry with smoke. While the crew appears to have contained the fire properly and the ferry most likely had a fire suppression system, excess water was not removed afterwards. This caused the ferry to become unstable as its center of gravity was no longer fixed. Rough winds were then able to knock the ship over in what is known as a Free Surface Effect.",

His permanent contract was to run until the end of the 2010–11 season.\n\nThe 50 year old former Tottenham Hotspur and Republic of Ireland defender joined the club in 2008 when he was appointed Newcastle United assistant manager by Kevin Keegan, with the club at the time in the top flight of English football, the Premier League. Hughton then became temporary Newcastle United caretaker manager twice last season, as managers came and went, and at the end of the season, the club were ultimately relegated to the second tier, the Football League Championship. In his third spell as caretaker, he had been in charge of the club since the start of the season, and had guided the team to the top of the table, and for his efforts was awarded the Football League Championship Manager of the Month twice, for August and September.\n\nHughton stated of his appointment:\n\n\"It's a very proud day for me to be named as the manager of this magnificent football club. I will be doing everything in my power to get the club back into the Premier League at the first time of asking. Having the unequivocal backing of the players has helped me enormously and I would also like to thank Colin Calderwood, Paul Barron and the rest of the backroom staff who have been tremendously supportive to me this season.\"\n\nAccording to Sky Sports, many Newcastle fans had 'made no secret of their desire' to see a return to the club as manager of Alan Shearer after relegation and over the summer break. Shearer, the former club captain, was hired on a short term 8 game contract at the end of last season, but could not steer the club away from relegation. As the new season progressed, Hughton remained caretaker, and ten days prior to Hughton's appointment, Shearer had said:\n\n\"I can't revolve my life around that any more because I have other things going on. If it happens, it happens, and if it doesn't, it doesn't...And at the moment Chris Hughton is doing a great job.\"\n\nThe announcement came on the same day as it announced that the club would be putting the naming rights of the club stadium St James' Park up for offers next season, and that owner Mike Ashley was taking the club off the market for a second time.",

    "original_text": "2009 Queensland Election\nWikinews recently held an interview with the Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) political party about the upcoming Queensland state election.\n\nDS4SEQ is a single issue party which, as its name suggests, advocates the implementation of daylight saving in South East Queensland. Currently Queensland runs on Australian Eastern Standard Time (UTC+10).\n__NoTOC__\n\nWikinewsWhy have daylight saving in only part of the state instead of the whole state?\n\nDaylight Saving in Queensland appears to be a geographical issue. The results of the 1992 Referendum show that the concept was favoured by 51 (out of 89) electorates, all of which were located in the South East Queensland Region. In 2007, the Queensland Government commissioned AC Nielsen to undertake research. The results of this research indicated that 69% of respondants in the South East Queensland region were in favour of Daylight Saving, with only 20% opposed. This research also indicated that 59% of respondants outside of the South East region were opposed to Daylight Saving being introduced into their region. Overall those opposed to daylight saving in Queensland has decreased from 54.5% in 1992 to only 34% against, according to the Nielsen findings. South East Queensland businesses are also overwhelmingly in favour of having Daylight Saving introduced into the region.\n\nAs Daylight Saving is not favoured outside of the South East Queensland region, DS4SEQ believe that a dual time zone is a compromise that respects the needs of regional and rural Queenslanders, while also giving fair consideration to the view of the majority of residents in South East Queensland.\n\nWikinewsWhat benefits would daylight saving have for South East Queensland?\n\nBy moving the time of the clock against the natural occurring solar movement, Daylight Saving provides allowance for an hour less sunlight in the very early morning, when about 80% of people are sleeping, and provide an hour more sunlight in the evening, which can the be utilised. Benefits that can be gained from the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland are:\n\n* Promotes more of an outdoor lifestyle\n* Allows more time for outdoor family activities\n* Allows more time to perform outdoor garden activities e.g. mowing the lawn\n* Provides a positive effect on health\n* Improved safety and security for evening leisure activities and public transport\n* Promotes tourism\n* Increases economic efficiences for majority of business dealings from South East Queensland\n* Studies have suggested that, in the long term, Daylight Saving can reduce traffic accidents and road fatalities.\n\nWikinewsHow soon would you like to see a referendum on the issue of daylight saving?\n\nDS4SEQ are not advocating a referendum. DS4SEQ's political goal is to convince the major parties to change their thinking about Daylight Saving in Queensland, to adapt to Queensland's changing landscape and \"It's About Time!\" that serious consideration was given to our dual time zone concept.\n\nWikinewsWhat questions would you like see on the ballot paper for said referendum?\n\nAs per the previous question, DS4SEQ are not advocating a referendum, but seeking a revised policy on Daylight Saving in Queensland, by both major parties, to seriously consider a dual time zone arrangement for 6 months of the year.\n\nWikinewsWill DS4SEQ keep campaigning for daylight saving in South East Queensland if you don't get any seats in parliament?\n\nThe current stance taken by both major parties, in relation to Daylight Saving in Queensland, is outdated, out of touch and inflexible. South East Queenslanders are frustrated that neither major party is currently prepared to explore options on the issue of Daylight Saving.\n\nWhilst DS4SEQ is aiming to win seats in the Queensland Parliament, we believe that gaining a sizeable percentage of the primary vote will send the key message to the major parties that they can no longer ignore: When it comes to the issue of Daylight Saving, the people of South East Queensland have been ignored for too long, and a dual time zone arrangement must be implemented.\n\nWith a sizeable percentage of the vote achieved, DS4SEQ will be able to lobby the Government and Opposition, with evidence that constituents are demanding Daylight Saving to be implemented within the South East Queensland region.",

    "original_text": "ScientologyWikinews has learned that the Church of Scientology has begun to falsely accuse the internet protest group Anonymous of a 2007 school shooting in Finland.\n\nThe Church, on October 18, 2008 accused Anonymous of being involved in the November 2007 shooting at Jokela High School, in which a man named Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot and killed nine people, including himself.\n\n\"Anonymous member Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot and killed seven students, a nurse and a teacher at Jokela High School in Finland before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life,\" said the Church in the October 18 press release. On October 17, the President of the Church of Scientology in New York City, John Carmichael, also accused Anonymous of being behind the shooting.\n4=Tapio Ahola, Detective Chief Inspector of the NBI\nOne month ago, an article on CNN's citizen journalism wing, iReport, also accused Anonymous of being behind the shooting, and several other alleged terrorist plots. The article also went on to accuse Anonymous of being behind the suicide of 14-year-old Megan Meier who killed herself after being 'cyber-bullied'. Scientology says the initial attack was done by a member of Anonymous named Josh Evans, who later turned out to be a false alias created by Lori Drew, the mother of one of Meier's friends. Meier's mother had previously had a falling out with Drew.\n\nWikinews contacted the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) in Finland by e-mail, seeking evidence or a statement to confirm or deny any connection to Anonymous and verify or debunk the claim made by the Church. Wikinews was able to confirm that there was no connection between Anonymous and the 2007 shooting.\n\n\"According to the leader of the criminal investigation of the Jokela High School Shooting in 2007, there was no link between the group called 'Anonymous' and the offender Auvinen,\" said Tapio Ahola, Detective Chief Inspector of the NBI to Wikinews.\n\nThe Church also accuses Anonymous of plotting terrorist attacks against other schools, stadiums and even plotting a mall massacre which would allegedly have taken place in Los Angeles, California.\n\nWhat do you think about these claims made by the Church of Scientology?\nThe Church says that Jarrad Willis, who was arrested and questioned after posting the hoax massacre threat on 4chan.org, committed suicide while awaiting charges of internet crimes. Wikinews found that his suicide happened just one day before he was to be charged for a crime unrelated to the threat and that authorities had dropped all other charges against him, in relation to the hoax.\n\nThe accusations appear to be part of a Scientology tactic developed by the organization's founder, L. Ron Hubbard called \"fair-game\". The Church uses this tactic to harass people, often fabricating lies and defamation against those who protest or criticize their beliefs. Wikinews contacted the Church several times by e-mail for a statement, but the Church has yet to reply.",

Yahoo!7 is the joint venture between Yahoo! and Australian network, Seven.\n\nThe join venture replaces the current and long-lasting partnership between Microsoft and Xtra, called XtraMSN. The current partnership's contract will expire at the end of this year. Telecom chose to change the partnership because Yahoo! has worked together with BT Group, Verizon and Rogers Communications.\n\nThe new site, along with new online content will go online on around March 1, 2007.\n\nThe partnership will result in Yahoo!7 taking 51% control of the partnership and Xtra taking the remaining 49%.\n\nKevin Kenrick, chief operating officer of Telecom, said that they will now be able to target the underdeveloped online advertising community. \"We see there is a fantastic opportunity to grow online advertising and the share of the online market. Online advertising in New Zealand is getting to a tipping point of growth where there is a critical mass of online connections, broadband connections and an increase in the amount of time people are spending online.\"\n\nWhen the new site is launched, it will include a range of news, sport, weather, enhanced e-mail spam and virus protection, photo sharing, and internet radio.\n\nTheresa Gattung, chief executive of Telecom, said: \"The Yahoo Xtra joint venture will provide New Zealanders with access to the world's best online services in a localised way.\"\n\nIan Smith, chief executive of Yahoo!7, said: \"The company was achieving market growth of online advertising of between 50 and 60 per cent a year in Australia and believed it could do the same in New Zealand.\" He said that the partnership will give them a great opportunity to showcase its tools, technology and platforms in New Zealand.\n\nMr Kenrick said that the reason they had gotten a partnership with Yahoo!7 was that it is very difficult for a small player to develop its services in a New Zealand size market.\n\nOne other online company Xtra had considered for the partnership was Google, among others. The reason they chose Yahoo!7 over other companies was because Yahoo!7 has the top position in big fields such as TV and video. Mr Kenrick said: \"The whole area of content management is one we thought would benefit from others with greater expertise and more scope.\"\n\nTelecom manages 80% of the telecommunication market.",

The traditional owners of the site in the Arrernte Nation say they will continue to protest against the facility near the Stuart Highway about 20 kilometres north of Alice Springs.\n\nThe Federal Government wants an operating licence for a new reactor in Sydney, to replace the ageing Lucas Heights facility. One of the key conditions for the operating licence of a new reactor is the establishment of a viable waste management plan. In July the federal government announced a short list of three locations in the Northern Territory as potential sites for a radioactive waste dump. The Government wants a facility to store and manage low and intermediate level radioactive waste resulting from the medical, industrial and research use of radioactive materials by Commonwealth agencies.\n\nTraditional owners of Athenge Alhere - an estate group of the Arrernte Nation - have voiced their dissent to the nuclear dump and say they don’t want waste from Sydney’s Lucas Heights nuclear reactor brought to their land. \"Because the land we take care of, because all our ancestors lived in this land and hunted on this land as well, so it's mainly because of the animals and the next generation of our kids and their children, so we still say no,\" traditional owner Benedict Stevens said.\n\nThe Medical Association for Prevention of War condemned as \"scaremongering\" the claims by Federal MPs that the health of Australians would be in jeopardy if a nuclear waste dump was not imposed on the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth Government.\n\nThe three proposed sites include:\n\n* Fishers Ridge, a defence site 42km south-east of Katherine.\n* Harts Range, a defence site 165km north-east of Alice Springs.\n* Mount Everard a defence site 27km north-west of Alice Springs.\n\nThe NT Government cannot prevent the dump from proceeding, as all three sites are all on Commonwealth land. Although the Northern Territory Parliament has passed legislation banning the storage or transport of any nuclear waste, the Federal Government is able to use its external affairs power to override the legislation.\n\nThe Federal Government abandoned locating the dump in South Australia and Western Australia following local opposition.\n\nA final decision is expected to be made by the end of 2006, with the preferred site to be operational by 2011.",

Taiwanese literature commentator Nan Fang Shou (南方朔, pen-name by Xin-ching Wang, 王杏慶) said the following at the seminar:\nEven though this novel The Banquet Bug focused on phenomena of \"cheating\", it evidently showed the presence of society in several places or incidents.\nAt the other seminar, \"On Trends in Creative Chinese Literature\", which focused on wuxia novels, famous Taiwanese novelist Da-chuen Chang (張大春) commented with some specialists on wuxia novels and said:\nThe wuxia novel in the Chinese-language world is very valuable, especially in some elements, story construction, history background, gangsters related to Chinese martial-arts, because several elements above may not be seen in Western (European and American) novels. I think the traditions in the Chinese-language world can still keep in path even though Jin Yong's novels were famous in the past.\n\nIn fact, the novel and fiction authoring in Taiwan has generally been steady and varied with such examples and the maturation of independent authoring.",

    "original_text": "Russia has ended exports of natural gas to neighbouring Ukraine following a failure to reach a compromise over prices. Gazprom, Russia's natural gas behemoth, began cutting off supplies at 7:00 a.m. UTC Sunday, January 1.\n\nGazprom claims to have taken this action because Ukraine refuses to pay the market rate for natural gas which is approximately four times higher than the price previously agreed upon by the two. Ukraine has stated that they are not averse to higher prices but believe they ought to be introduced sequentially. Additionally, Russia does not want to honor its contract to supply gas at $50 per 1000 cubic meters until 2008. By comparison, gas produced by OPEC costs $11.4 per 1000 cubic feet (December 28, 2005), equivalent to $402.6 per 1000 cubic meters, an 8-fold rebate.\n\nGazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said enough gas was still being piped via Ukraine to maintain deliveries to other countries, and if they were not getting all their gas, it meant Ukraine was tapping into it. Eighty percent of Russian gas exports to Western Europe pass through Ukraine.\n\n\"We have information from the ground that shows Ukraine has started illegally siphoning off Russian gas destined for European consumers,\" Kupriyanov said.\n\nUkraine is of the position that since Russia will not live up to the agreement to sell at $50 per 1000 cubic meters until 2008, Ukraine as a transiting country, has the right to offset the illegal cost increase with seizure of Russian assets - namely the gas going through the pipelines in Ukraine.\n\nSergei Kupriyanov, press secretary to Gazprom's chief executive, said \"Negotiations reach a deadlock when it comes to discussing actual figures ... They have called on us to use price parameters that probably existed in the late 1990s in 2006, which is impossible ... The price of gas and other energy resources has risen considerably over the past few years.\"\n\nThe dispute is also tied to the political situation between the two countries. Although a private business, the largest individual shareholder in Gazprom is the Russian government which owns slightly less than 40%. The dispute was further politicized by the personal intervention of Vladimir Putin who offered Ukraine the chance to delay paying market prices for a further three months. Critics of the current Russian government have argued that Gazprom's action has been an attempt to punish Ukraine for forging closer links with the West following the Orange Revolution. Putin's advocates, however, have argued that the status quo is akin to a budgetary transfer between the two governments and costs Russia about US$4.5 billion per year.\nSpecial European commission has already counted gas independently,and confirmed its loss. But Ukraine disagrees,saing,that it is unjust.German Kanzler Angela Merkel hopes,that the conflict will end soon.\nAnd a recent poll conducted by VTSIOM suggests that 80% of Russian citizens support the move by Gazprom. Ukraine has threatened to retaliate by raising the rent that Russia's navy pays to use the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol as headquarters for its Black Sea fleet, and refusing to repair Russian rockets, which can be repaired only there.",

Torn apart, they eventual decide to find peer pressure head-on, as \"the Bratz\".\n\nDirector Sean McNamara commented in press materials, \"The producers, writers and I hung out and talked about the fact that we had all lost friendships during high school, not because you want to but you start meeting new people and start hanging out with people that are into the same things as you.\"\n\n\"This theme of cliques still happens even when you grow up, it's in the business world — hey they are everywhere,\" McNamara continued. \"I think that's what I'm trying to say with this movie is that you don't have to be part of a clique exclusively. You can have friends all over the place and still be with kids that are into what you’re into... be with your jock friends, your science friends, whomever.\"\n\nActress Logan Browning comments, \"Friendships are so important because you can think that you can go to school and be by yourself and be the coolest girl but without true friends, you’re going to be stuck in your life.\"\n\nThe movie is produced by Avi Arad, a producer of the Spider-Man and X-Men trilogies, The Hulk, The Fantastic Four, The Punisher, and Ghost Rider.\n\nArad feels that \"If we can unite kids without taking away their individuality, that's fantastic.\"\n\nMuchOnDemand is a long-running program MuchMusic, Canada's primary music channel.

Windows metafiles often use the extension .wmf files, but they may also execute if their extension is .jpeg, .png or any other common image extension.\n\nThis vulnerability affects any Windows software which displays images, including instant messenger software, email clients, and web browsers. Firefox reduces the vulnerability by asking a user before executing Windows metafiles, but metafiles masquerading as another format will still be executed automatically by the operating system.\n\nMicrosoft has not yet issued a patch for the vulnerability, prompting Ilfak Guilfanov to release an unofficial patch. Microsoft's security advisory recommends unregistering shimgvw.dll to disable handling of Windows MetaFiles. Critics point out that shimgvw.dll could become re-registered by malicious processes or other installations. They also suggest that malicious Windows Metafiles could merely remain \"dormant\" until shimgvw.dll is re-registered.\n\nThe exploit has been used to attack online forums which allow embedding of image files via &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tags, prompting some gaming forums to disable &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; tags . Any site accepting image media upload, such as avatars, will also be vulnerable if this site accepts .wmf files, possibly masquerading as another media file format. \n\nThe exploit has also been used by an instant messaging worm, which appears to provide a backdoor for later exploitation via an IRC bot .\n\nThe McAfee antivirus company said the WMF vulnerability is being exploited to drop over 30 variants of the Bifrose backdoor trojan horse, and exploitation by other malware is likely. McAfee estimates the first generation of such exploits had infected more than 6% of their customer base by 31 December 2005.\n\n\"The WMF vulnerability probably affects more computers than any other security vulnerability, ever,\" said Mikko of F-Secure. \n\nWindows Metafile vulnerability\n* F-secure's coverage of the vulnerability\n* Viruslist.com's anaysis of the IM worm.\n* Viruslist.com's initial report\n* Microsoft Security Advisory (912840)\n* US-CERT Vulnerability Note VU#181038\n* Internet Storm Center WMF FAQ",

Police records show that the teenager had no record of drug abuse or mental illness, and was known by neighbours to be a well behaved, polite boy. The only clue to the motivation of the murder was when he told police \"the world would be better with fewer people\" during interrogation.\n\nThe teenager attacked his mother, 42, and 12-year-old sister in their flat while his father was working at the family-owned restaurant situated across the road. After killing them, he fled the scene and called police at approximately 3:30 a.m. HKT (1930 UTC, July 21) from a telephone booth in a nearby park. As he was waiting for the police to arrive, he cut a wound in his own hand. When police found him, he was wearing black gloves and was covered in bloodstains, and carrying the chopper in his rucksack. They escorted him back to the family home and discovered his mother and sister's bodies which were inflicted with extensive knife wounds to their necks and abdomens. The boy's father temporarily shut down his restaurant as a result of the murder, and visited his son in hospital while he was receiving treatment for his hand laceration.\n\nThe boy, who studies at Po Leung Kuk Lee Shing Pik College, ranked first in class in Primary Six, and was known to be well behaved, friendly and hard-working. His principal, his father, an employee at the family's restaurant and a neighbour were said to be shocked at the news of the murders. The local newspaper vendor described him as \"polite\". There have been no record of any arguments among the family members; however, graffiti which is believed to have been written by the teenager was found on the walls of the block of flats where the boy lives. The graffiti includes foul language, including \"shit\" and \"bitch\", as well as \"I love you\" and \"Happy birthday (little sister)\". A psychiatrist told Hong Kong newspaper The Standard that he may have committed the murder as a result of incubated mental illness that his family were not aware he was suffering from, or that he may have experienced a huge setback or terrible experience.",

The plans ensure that only \"patriots\" to the People's Republic of China would be allowed to run. This comes after protests against the republic over the last two years, with 47 pro-democracy election candidates, activists, and campaigners remaining in jail on national security laws.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang said he would \"resolutely guard against and deter\" interference from other countries during the annual work report. Li delivered a speech to about 3000 members of the congress. As a result, a draft decision was made, containing recommendations from Wang Chen, who is the vice chair of the standing committee of the NPC. It included modifications to the Hong Kong constitution, including granting a committee that currently elects the chief executive additional powers to \"directly participate in the nomination of all legislative council members\", and create \"a qualification vetting system for the whole process\".\n\nPolitical scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong Willy Lam told Agence France-Presse the vetting committee proposed by the NPC would to disqualify any candidate from running for office who was seen as not being loyal to the Chinese Communist Party. After the plans were announced, Beijing's liaison office said \"from all walks of life in Hong Kong have voiced their support\" for the changes.\n\nIn last year's work report, national security laws were introduced that gave the Chinese government more powers to convict residents of Hong Kong and prevent them from running for office. On Thursday, 47 pro-democracy activists and potential election candidates were still being held after an informal \"primary poll\" they had carried out, which prosecutors said was designed to \"overthrow\" the government.\n\nThis comes after about a thousand protestors had gathered outside the Hong Kong court on Monday demanding the release of what they called \"political prisoners\", The Guardian reported. Those arrested were charged under the laws on Sunday. The Guardian said 32 were denied bail, in part because the national security laws make it difficult for those arrested to be given bail. Fifteen defendants were granted bail that prosecutors opposed.",

Things will start moving to the north because of Wynn Las Vegas, Sheldon Adelson with the expansion of the Venetian, the New Frontier -- that whole area will become the new hot area of Las Vegas for the next decade or so,\" gaming expert Anthony Curtis told Las Vegas KLAS TV.\n\nAs the property opened to the public, developer Steve Wynn greeted visitors at the front entrance.\n\n\"It's always fascinating to watch people enter the thing and get their first moment after we open the doors,\" Wynn told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nThe sign in front of the Wynn property has an unusual mechanical design, with a large piece containing the Wynn logo, which can move vertically up or down as different announcements are presented.\nAnalysts are not too concerned about the cost of the Wynn development. Wynn paid off the cost of The Mirage hotel-casino in 18 months, much earlier than the planned seven years for which the debt had been scheduled for repayment.\n\n\"If you remember the opening of The Mirage in 1989, Wynn needed to make a nut of $1 million a day. Everyone thought he was nuts; 'couldn't be done,' they all said,\" Las Vegas history department Chairman Hal Rothman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nWynn sold his interest in Mirage Resorts to MGM Grand (which became MGM Mirage and is now run by Kirk Kerkorian) for US$6.4 billion back in 2000, then turned around and purchased the property for the Wynn hotel-casino for US$275 million. The property was previously the home of the Desert Inn.\n\nThe hotel has 2,359 rooms, and a few hundred deluxe suites and \"parlors\" for high rollers. The casino has 1,960 slot machines and 137 table games on a 111,000 square foot casino floor. A Ferrari-Maserati dealership and the Le Reve stage show, featuring a million gallon water tank, round out the expensive offerings.\n\nA round of golf will go for US$500 on the elaborate golf course located behind the main building.\n\nAll of these specifications add up to a record construction cost of over one million US dollars per room. Other expensive Las Vegas properties cost a fraction of the price, such as the Bellagio, which cost half the price at US$533,000 per room. The most expensive hotel property in the world was previously the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui, Hawaii, which cost US$775,000 per room.\n\n\"Yes, (Wynn) may be in over his head, but then he has found ways to survive before,\" Las Vegas professor Bill Thompson told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nSeveral of Wynn's largest competitors spoke with admiration of the property and looked forward to its impact on Las Vegas.\n\n\"I've never understood the hand-wringing about something new, especially in Las Vegas and Atlantic City,\" Harrah's Chairman and CEO Gary Loveman told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nOther casino bosses from the Mandalay and the MGM Mirage had positive comments as well, hoping to pick up some new business from the development.\n\n\"It's a positive in terms of bringing more visitors,\" Mandalay Resort Group President and CEO Glenn Schaeffer told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\n\"Steve will build a great property and bring new people to town. If we're doing what we're supposed to be doing, then we'll pick up some of that business also,\" MGM Mirage Chairman and CEO Terry Lanni told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nThousands of visitors gathered for hours in front of the property before it opened. Security guards had to monitor the number of visitors entering the building.\n\n\"I think it's spectacular,\" David Schwartz, coordinator of the Gaming Studies Research Center at the University of Nevada Las Vegas told Reuters.\n\n\"People were pushing and shoving,\" Las Vegan Kathie Anderson told Associated Press.\n\n\"There is nobody in the world who creates such entertaining and beautiful casinos,\" British billionaire Richard Branson told Associated Press from the casino floor. \"I would say every other casino must be nervous. He's lifted the bar dramatically,\" Branson said.\n\n\"This would be hard to top,\" Las Vegan Marlene DeMarco told Reuters.",

The massive storm stretches from New Mexico to Maine.\n\nChicago received 19.5 inches (45.53 cm) of snow by Wednesday morning, and winds reached speeds of 50 mph (80.46 kph) in the night. Other places such as Buffalo, New York could get up to eight inches (20 cm) of snow by Thursday. The storm brought badly needed rain to areas in the United States south, but also hit the Florida panhandle with a tornado watch.\n\nChicago and nearby areas also experienced thundersnow at times. Thundersnow is a type of thunderstorm with snow falling instead of rain.\n\nMany power failures occurred in hard-hit areas, due to icing, which coated power lines with thick ice. Up to 18,000 customers in Indiana lost power, and almost 80,000 ComEd customers in the Chicago area were without power. Thousands in Oklahoma also lost power.\n\n\"If you don't have to travel, don't do it. If you can stay home, do it. You might get in.

Over 20% of flights in the United States were grounded due to bad weather, and Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport had to close Tuesday morning due to an ice storm.\n\nThe snowstorm may affect 100 million Americans, roughly a third of that country's population. \"It's unusual for a storm to affect such a broad swath of the country and so many big cities,\" said :The Weather Channel meteorologist Mark Ressler. The snowfall rate in some places was \"incredibly heavy,\" he added.\n\nIn Chicago, where snow was heaviest, 2,200 flights were cancelled at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. Chicago Midway Airport, the city's smaller airport, suspended flight operations. Classes within the Chicago Public School system were cancelled for Wednesday, the first time since 1999.

Taking the oath of office, Yushchenko added \"This is a victory of freedom over tyranny. The victory of law over lawlessness.\"\n\nOpposition candidate and Russian backed Viktor Yanukovych has challenged the validity of the election rerun on December 26 2004, which saw his victory overruled. As recently as a few days ago, the Supreme Court overruled a final request to delay the ceremony. Mr Yanukovych has stated that he will take his battle to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nIn a ceremony watched by eight heads of state, Viktor Yushchenko urged unity between sides and promised deeper integration into the European Union.",

    "original_text": "This year's session of the \"United Nations Climate Change Conference\", which includes meetings of the COP and CMP, begins next week in Bali, Indonesia. The Conference is the place where formal decisions regarding the Kyoto Protocol will be made and discussed. Several participants and observers agree that getting on track for a regulatory agreement on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 2012 onwards is going be one of the main challenges in the upcoming talks.\n4=Yvo de Boer\nSetting an agenda and a date for completion of negotiations on a post-2012 climate change agreement at the upcoming conference in Bali is of great importance, stated Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in an interview given to Inter Press Service last week. De Boer declared that he does not \"expect Bali to agree on targets and finalise a regime\", and sees the real work in \"designing a global agreement that encompasses every country while recognising the need of different approaches with different people\" during the short span of the next two years. However, making the decision to launch negotiations is a prerequisite to this, and in that regards he says that \"...for me Bali is very much a make or a break.\"\n\nThe European Commission said in a press release from Tuesday: \"The ... conference ... must agree to launch negotiations on a comprehensive and ambitious global climate change agreement for the period after 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period ends.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown stated in a speech that \"the task of Bali sounds quite specific: to launch negotiations leading to a post-2012 global agreement on climate change. But our mission is in truth historic and it is world changing&amp;mdash;to build over the next 50 years and beyond a global low carbon economy.\"\n\nThe United States seems to agree as the Department of State noted in a press release that \"we are committed to developing an environmentally effective and economically sustainable post-2012 framework to address climate change.\"\n\nIn its information for the press, the UNFCCC secretariat states that the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report made it unmistakenably clear that the problem and danger of global warming needs to be tackled immediately, and with a world wide response. While the Kyoto Protocol includes reduction targets for the signatory developed nations through 2012, the communique says that a \"new international climate change deal must be put in place\" so that no time gap occurs between the current measures to reduce GHGs until the end of the current phase and those measures that will be applied thereafter.",

According to Syrian state media, government forces began deploying into previously SDF controlled territory yesterday. Also on Sunday, the United States announced a complete withdrawal from the region, beyond the withdrawal from the \"immediate area\" first announced seven days earlier on October 6.\n\nIn a statement, the SDF said, \"An agreement has been reached with the Syrian government &amp;mdash; whose duty it is to protect the country's borders and preserve Syrian sovereignty &amp;mdash; for the Syrian Army to enter and deploy along the Syrian-Turkish border to help the SDF stop the Turkish aggression\".\n\nThe Syrian Army &amp;mdash; whose commander-in-chief is President Bashar al-Assad &amp;mdash; entered Tell Tamer and Ain Issa yesterday according to state media. The SDF said hundreds of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) fighters escaped following Turkish airstrikes from a camp at Ain Issa.\n\nOn October 6, US President Donald Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke on the phone. Then both nations issued statements speaking of an imminent incursion into northeast Syria, and the US statement spoke of Turkey assuming the duty of guarding captured ISIS militants.\n\nOn Wednesday, Turkey began a military offensive with airstrikes followed by a ground invasion. Erdoğan said the invasion was \"to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area.\" He named it \"Operation Peace Spring\" and named both the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and People's Protection Units (YPG) as terrorists. PKK is a banned militant organization in Turkey; YPG is the main fighting force of the SDF, largely Kurdish and, according to Turkey, supportive of the PKK.\n\nThe operation was condemned by members of the European Union. Erdoğan cited Article 5 of the NATO treaty and said, \"They need to stand by us\", while addressing the press yesterday. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg wrote, \"I count on Turkey to act with restraint &amp; ensure that the gains we have made in the fight against ISIS are not jeopardised.\"",
